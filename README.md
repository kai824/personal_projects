# personal_projects
Here are some projects that I personally worked on in my leisure time over the years.

Competitive programming: contains some of the codes that I have written in my training for competitive programming. Other codes can be accessed at my codeforces profiles at https://codeforces.com/profile/kai824
Games: the game-related programmes that I have written, as it was often one of my main motivations to code in my earlier years
seq2seq chatbot: A chatbot that I attempted to make, based on tutorials about the sequence-to-sequence network architecture
