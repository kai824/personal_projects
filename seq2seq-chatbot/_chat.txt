[27/5/18, 4:37:38 PM] Yi Kai: Ok true

[27/5/18, 4:38:35 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: Can sec 4s opt out of ssg cape
[27/5/18, 4:38:41 PM] Yi Kai: I don't know

[27/5/18, 4:39:05 PM] Yi Kai: But in that case what should HTD plan for Sec 4 squad?
[27/5/18, 4:51:20 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: Same lor

[28/5/18, 6:13:12 AM] Yi Kai: Why ask us availability on every day
[28/5/18, 6:21:35 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: Same
[28/5/18, 6:21:41 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: I dont think we need to go for that though
[28/5/18, 6:21:48 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: They are probably just asking for fun
[28/5/18, 6:36:57 AM] Yi Kai: Yah
[28/5/18, 6:37:10 AM] Yi Kai: Probably just asking to check how good you are at emails
[28/5/18, 7:09:23 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: Lmao
[2/6/18, 1:31:42 PM] Yi Kai: For the SMTP meeting with principal Adriale want us go for CSI...

[2/6/18, 1:44:15 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: I agree
[2/6/18, 1:44:25 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: The toppins one wasnt even necessary
[2/6/18, 2:12:25 PM] Yi Kai: It's just to clock UOPA points actually
[2/6/18, 2:20:46 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: Ew
[2/6/18, 2:21:35 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: So do we respond to the iemb message saying we cant go

[3/6/18, 10:08:13 PM] Yi Kai: Why my interview slot at 11.30am siah
[3/6/18, 10:08:38 PM] Yi Kai: I have tuition from 10-12, then I can't make it, but I don't think they will accept tuition as valid reason
[3/6/18, 10:31:00 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: Unlucky
[3/6/18, 10:31:09 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: Can u change ur tuition timing
[3/6/18, 10:31:09 PM] Yi Kai: True

[3/6/18, 10:32:07 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: Mm
[3/6/18, 10:32:18 PM] Yi Kai: Yah can lah
[3/6/18, 10:32:30 PM] Yi Kai: But why must my interview be right before lunch siah
[3/6/18, 10:32:40 PM] Yi Kai: It makes my interview longer, plus maumu knows me
[3/6/18, 10:32:52 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: Wdym maumu knows you
[3/6/18, 10:33:23 PM] Yi Kai: What do you think? I have sent enough direct emails to him for ops and stuff

[3/6/18, 10:34:21 PM] Yi Kai: Yah I know
[3/6/18, 10:34:51 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: How are u preparing for ur interview
[3/6/18, 10:35:50 PM] Yi Kai: Just think about how to defend myself when my loopholes are pointed out
[3/6/18, 10:36:02 PM] Yi Kai: For us they can't really question us about MSG
[3/6/18, 10:38:27 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: That sucks
[3/6/18, 10:38:30 PM] Yi Kai: Why?
[3/6/18, 10:38:35 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: I would rather them ask about msg
[3/6/18, 10:38:39 PM] Yi Kai: True
[3/6/18, 10:38:44 PM] Yi Kai: Just think about the "initiatives"
[3/6/18, 10:38:47 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: At least we can bs something about time management
[3/6/18, 10:39:06 PM] Yi Kai: True
[3/6/18, 10:39:12 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: Theres not much initiatives that can be come up for logs
[3/6/18, 10:39:18 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: Aaa
[3/6/18, 10:39:36 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: And then if u get head then ull get zam by maumu every exco meeting
[3/6/18, 10:39:37 PM] Yi Kai: Weihan forgot to bring his pants for first class and got some very very crumpled pants
[3/6/18, 10:39:52 PM] Yi Kai: According to Zong Jun maumu likes him
[3/6/18, 10:40:14 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: What then logs supposed to provide crisp ironed pants for cadets ah
[3/6/18, 10:40:20 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: Yah he told me too
[3/6/18, 10:40:30 PM] Yi Kai: At least up to standard right?
[3/6/18, 10:40:41 PM] Yi Kai: Not so stupidly crumpled. At least ironed to some extent
[3/6/18, 10:41:37 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: But i think maumu will question the feasibility of this
[3/6/18, 10:42:24 PM] Yi Kai: I mean you just iron once lah
[3/6/18, 10:42:32 PM] Yi Kai: Pants don't crumple so easily
[3/6/18, 10:42:37 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: Anyways this thing is a bit stupid tho
[3/6/18, 10:42:42 PM] Yi Kai: I'm quite gged with my school hw
[3/6/18, 10:43:00 PM] Yi Kai: I calculated that if I want to finish them on 10 June I need to finish 2.5 hrs of homework every day
[3/6/18, 10:43:00 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: Why do we need to go for interview its just a secondary school cca thing
[3/6/18, 10:43:09 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: Why 10 june
[3/6/18, 10:43:15 PM] Yi Kai: 'Cause it's NPCC
[3/6/18, 10:43:21 PM] Yi Kai: 'Cause I want holidays
[3/6/18, 10:43:31 PM] Yi Kai: And after 10 June that's when my random programmes start to come out
[3/6/18, 10:43:31 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: I havent started on homework
[3/6/18, 10:43:35 PM] Yi Kai: ...
[3/6/18, 10:43:39 PM] Yi Kai: Ok cool

[3/6/18, 10:43:50 PM] Yi Kai: Just start soon 'cause it's not little
[3/6/18, 10:43:58 PM] Yi Kai: especially if you need to go lab or something
[3/6/18, 10:43:59 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: Same
[3/6/18, 10:44:13 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: I have like 3 free days
[3/6/18, 10:44:28 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: Others taken up by random stuff like camp and lab
[3/6/18, 10:45:56 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: And the peer appraisal thing also a bit retarded
[3/6/18, 10:46:01 PM] Yi Kai: Yah
[3/6/18, 10:46:13 PM] Yi Kai: At first I was expecting that they will make us write stuff about each other
[3/6/18, 10:46:23 PM] Yi Kai: But they end up making us rank each other
[3/6/18, 10:46:44 PM] Yi Kai: If we end up talking about it, none of it ever occured, just to keep the both of us safe, ok?
[3/6/18, 10:46:45 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: Its not that easy to rank lor
[3/6/18, 10:46:53 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: Lol ok
[3/6/18, 10:46:54 PM] Yi Kai: True. But there's RNG
[3/6/18, 10:47:08 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: Rng for what
[3/6/18, 10:47:17 PM] Yi Kai: If you dk how to rank

[3/6/18, 10:49:37 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: Ya probably
[3/6/18, 10:49:41 PM] Yi Kai: Ok
[4/6/18, 8:26:08 PM] Yi Kai: I feel bad doing the peer appraisal thing. It shows me constantly giving some people 20 or 21
[4/6/18, 8:26:31 PM] Yi Kai: 'cause someone has to take the last place after all
[4/6/18, 9:24:49 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: Same
[10/6/18, 2:40:27 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: Wait for the pir interview is it only maumu will be there

[10/6/18, 4:05:27 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: Idk tbh
[10/6/18, 4:05:35 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: Its so cringey to praise ueself
[10/6/18, 4:05:50 PM] Yi Kai: Exactly

[11/6/18, 6:16:56 PM] Yi Kai: Then he was like so are you going to be a dictator towards the NCOs simply because you're a planner and not a doer?
[11/6/18, 6:17:02 PM] Yi Kai: I was like wth
[11/6/18, 6:17:04 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: Then maumu was talking about applying for AI

[11/6/18, 6:19:06 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: All my answers quite smoke
[11/6/18, 6:19:12 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: But they never expose my smoke
[11/6/18, 6:19:26 PM] Yi Kai: Cause one of the things they ask is if you're the department head who do you want as your deputy heads
[11/6/18, 6:19:43 PM] Yi Kai: Then for htd Xiang Yang was like who do you want for UP div and HTF

[11/6/18, 6:21:02 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: Rlly
[11/6/18, 6:21:04 PM] Yi Kai: Which was quite stupid

[11/6/18, 10:15:33 PM] Yi Kai: I have no idea why I went for it. I just applied for the sake of it. And now it seems like it
[11/6/18, 10:15:38 PM] Yi Kai: No one
[11/6/18, 10:15:49 PM] Yi Kai: Actually not many people even know I applying for pubs

[11/6/18, 10:17:10 PM] Yi Kai: But the thing is I don't even have a DSLR camera...

[13/6/18, 10:09:42 PM] Yi Kai: Yes it's Bukit Timah nature reserve. It's just that there's a stupid permit we need to get at least 1 month ahead, so Mr Tan emailed them alr. The Botanic Gardens one is just in case we don't get the permit

[16/6/18, 7:45:13 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: I have no motivation to salvage my t3 msg anymore
[16/6/18, 7:45:31 PM] Yi Kai: ...
[16/6/18, 7:45:36 PM] Yi Kai: What's your T2 MSG
[16/6/18, 7:45:45 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: 1.25
[16/6/18, 7:45:48 PM] Yi Kai: Doesn't need to be salvaged
[16/6/18, 7:45:59 PM] Yi Kai: Improvement from last year or no?
[16/6/18, 7:46:10 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: From last years t2 msg ah

[17/6/18, 2:28:30 PM] Yi Kai: Only salts are separated I think
[17/6/18, 2:28:59 PM] Yi Kai: How does aqueous chlorine or iodine work though

‎[27/6/18, 9:54:49 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ‎image omitted
[27/6/18, 10:03:03 PM] Yi Kai: If you sub in the values of x^2 and y it's wrong?
[27/6/18, 10:03:29 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i cant find the mistake
[27/6/18, 10:03:52 PM] Yi Kai: X^2 should be -1 and y should be 2
[27/6/18, 10:05:59 PM] Yi Kai: Your multiplication looks definitely wrong
[27/6/18, 10:06:06 PM] Yi Kai: The last step
[27/6/18, 10:07:49 PM] Yi Kai: Wait a minute. Your determinant should be 3 not -63
[27/6/18, 10:08:14 PM] Yi Kai: It's - 3 x (-11) not +
[27/6/18, 10:08:27 PM] Yi Kai: And put the brackets. It's what I always get penalised for
[27/6/18, 10:46:42 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oh crap
[27/6/18, 10:46:46 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ok thankss
[28/6/18, 2:15:38 PM] Yi Kai: Much wow. Wei Kiat say the reason he gave me extra interview is cause the whole pubs dept peer appraisal score is quite Low
[28/6/18, 2:19:42 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: LOL
[28/6/18, 2:20:00 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: why u only one in the interview
[28/6/18, 2:20:28 PM] Yi Kai: Maybe he did interview Weihan and Avier
[28/6/18, 2:22:07 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: why need interview because of low peer appraisal though
[28/6/18, 2:25:04 PM] Yi Kai: Maumu not happy
[28/6/18, 2:25:14 PM] Yi Kai: Says that it doesn't show very well about pubs dept
[28/6/18, 2:25:48 PM] Yi Kai: And may mean that most of the exco won't work very well with pubs
[28/6/18, 2:26:15 PM] Yi Kai: Then he go and ask me to suggest reasons why my peer appraisal is so Low
[28/6/18, 2:29:37 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: wth
[28/6/18, 2:29:46 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: why u suggest
[28/6/18, 2:29:58 PM] Yi Kai: ?
[28/6/18, 2:30:04 PM] Yi Kai: You mean what?
[28/6/18, 2:30:10 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: how would u know why
[28/6/18, 2:30:26 PM] Yi Kai: I just say it's probably cause I became less enthu in Sec 3
[28/6/18, 2:30:35 PM] Yi Kai: And I try to avoid every squad outing
[28/6/18, 2:30:57 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: Lmao
[28/6/18, 2:30:59 PM] Yi Kai: At the end I ask if they go conference room regularly and Wei Kiat was like Junwei lives here
[28/6/18, 2:31:02 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: What squad outing
[28/6/18, 2:31:08 PM] Yi Kai: Exactly
[28/6/18, 2:31:18 PM] Yi Kai: But basically if there's one I'll avoid
[28/6/18, 2:31:40 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: go for eports
[28/6/18, 2:31:48 PM] Yi Kai: Ok true
[28/6/18, 8:57:09 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: How do you differentiate whether a matrix of 2 simultaneous equations has no solutions or infinite solutions
[28/6/18, 8:57:13 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: when the determinant is 0
[28/6/18, 9:06:04 PM] Yi Kai: Tbh I have no idea. I used algebric method 'cause they didn't say need matrix method anyway
[28/6/18, 9:06:32 PM] Yi Kai: 'Cause determinant 0 means the gradient for both lines is the same
[28/6/18, 9:06:50 PM] Yi Kai: But then to show the y-intercept is different then I just dao and use algebric method
[28/6/18, 9:20:55 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: This is confusing
‎[28/6/18, 9:23:05 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ‎image omitted
[28/6/18, 9:24:25 PM] Yi Kai: What are you trying to do?
[28/6/18, 9:24:33 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i have no idea
[28/6/18, 9:24:39 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: elimination i guess
[28/6/18, 10:17:41 PM] Yi Kai: Show it's the same formula by algebra 'cause that will mean infinite solutions
[28/6/18, 10:17:47 PM] Yi Kai: Then for solving use matrix method
[28/6/18, 10:18:06 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ok thanks

[1/7/18, 2:33:04 PM] Yi Kai: Erm abc doesn't need to be 0
[1/7/18, 2:35:03 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: but can it be 0
[1/7/18, 2:35:20 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: or am i supposed to not touch them at all
[1/7/18, 2:44:25 PM] Yi Kai: Yah
[1/7/18, 2:44:35 PM] Yi Kai: Because that will mean you don't need so many steps
[1/7/18, 2:44:44 PM] Yi Kai: For me I hax by finding online tools
[1/7/18, 3:01:52 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oh
[1/7/18, 3:01:53 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: what a scam
[1/7/18, 4:51:36 PM] Yi Kai: Which will succeed in 5 steps
[1/7/18, 5:00:13 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ok thanks
[1/7/18, 5:00:21 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: whats the point of learning this though
[1/7/18, 11:42:46 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: does reduced echelon matrix mean just the 3 diagonal 1s
[1/7/18, 11:42:58 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: the rest of the numbers dont matter
[1/7/18, 11:53:14 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ok nvm i get it
[4/7/18, 6:27:29 AM] Yi Kai: Crap I don't think I brought TD gold

[6/7/18, 9:34:40 AM] Yi Kai: I usually leave home earlier so I'll reach at 9.30 optimally
[6/7/18, 9:35:15 AM] Yi Kai: But then I tried factory resetting my phone to troubleshoot. No effect, so I had to restore it this morning. And it took very long

[30/7/18, 10:20:10 PM] Yi Kai: You’re supposed to reject one of the solutions since it’s in the 4th quadrant and the graph shows that there’s nothing in 4th quadrant
[30/7/18, 10:20:17 PM] Yi Kai: Simultaneous equations
[30/7/18, 10:20:19 PM] Yi Kai: Substitution

Ar of calcium
——————
Ar of calcium+Ar of carbon(12) +3(16)(oxygen)
[3/8/18, 8:10:12 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: lol i just realised

[5/8/18, 6:59:55 PM] Yi Kai: Yes
[5/8/18, 7:00:11 PM] Yi Kai: If there is 1 0.502 mol of Fe there is 1 mol of H2
[5/8/18, 7:00:26 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: but fe doesnt contain h
[5/8/18, 7:00:36 PM] Yi Kai: 'Cause if 0.502 mol of Fe then there is 2 times of that in no. of mol of HCl
[5/8/18, 7:00:54 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ohh
[5/8/18, 7:00:55 PM] Yi Kai: Doesn't matter though, can just say 1 mol of Fe causes 1 mol of H2 in the reaction
[5/8/18, 7:01:02 PM] Yi Kai: At least that's what I put
[5/8/18, 7:01:03 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: omg

[7/8/18, 9:03:30 PM] Yi Kai: I spent 1 hour polishing. And the results were rewarding siah
[7/8/18, 9:03:45 PM] Yi Kai: Considering the fact that I wouldn’t have made much progress with 演讲稿
[7/8/18, 9:10:49 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: lmao

[19/8/18, 8:37:24 PM] Yi Kai: Also, I probably won't be attending school tomorrow 'cause I'm sick
[19/8/18, 8:37:34 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oh no
[19/8/18, 8:37:35 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: gws
[19/8/18, 8:37:47 PM] Yi Kai: but then I have ses tomorrow
[19/8/18, 8:37:52 PM] Yi Kai: So I don't know what to do
[19/8/18, 8:38:04 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: so if the angle in radians is 5/6 pi then its alr in exact form
[19/8/18, 8:38:08 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: hmm
[19/8/18, 8:38:14 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: u should msg lim or sth
[19/8/18, 8:38:20 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: whos ur partner
[19/8/18, 8:38:26 PM] Yi Kai: Shuyi
[19/8/18, 8:38:30 PM] Yi Kai: Yes
[19/8/18, 8:38:44 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oh
[19/8/18, 8:38:51 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: uh
[19/8/18, 8:39:00 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: u should tell someone
[19/8/18, 8:39:08 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: either lim or ses rep
[19/8/18, 8:39:34 PM] Yi Kai: Just told shao jun
[19/8/18, 8:41:02 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: 0k
[19/8/18, 8:41:20 PM] Yi Kai: But then each time I tell Shuyi to send me slides he just ask me to help him look up info lol
[19/8/18, 8:41:31 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: hmm
[19/8/18, 8:41:30 PM] Yi Kai: So I have no idea how the slides are going, and I feel like a burden again
[19/8/18, 8:41:50 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: its fine
[22/8/18, 2:52:27 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: do u know where to get the properties list for the math ws?
[22/8/18, 2:52:44 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: cause we need to state the geometric property used right
[22/8/18, 2:52:58 PM] Yi Kai: Idk
[22/8/18, 2:53:04 PM] Yi Kai: It's the only thing I don't know how to do
[22/8/18, 2:53:09 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: lol
[22/8/18, 2:53:13 PM] Yi Kai: I never really needed it 'cause of exemption
[22/8/18, 2:53:18 PM] Yi Kai: But I used it sometimes in math ws
[22/8/18, 2:53:21 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: same
[22/8/18, 2:53:30 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: but its in my sec 1/sec 2 worksheets
[22/8/18, 2:53:40 PM] Yi Kai: And every time I used it I just ask my last year math teacher
[22/8/18, 2:53:45 PM] Yi Kai: Q sure I threw mine away
[22/8/18, 2:53:52 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oops
[22/8/18, 2:54:03 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: maumu expects us to write them right
[22/8/18, 2:56:03 PM] Yi Kai: No 💩
[22/8/18, 2:58:07 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i see
[22/8/18, 2:58:26 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: im lazy
‎[22/8/18, 5:14:25 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ‎image omitted
[22/8/18, 5:21:04 PM] Yi Kai: Doesn’t sin inverse already suggest a unit at the end
[22/8/18, 5:21:17 PM] Yi Kai: But for sin 45 the degree should be there
[22/8/18, 5:21:45 PM] Yi Kai: The correction tape though. But if I were to use correction tape and not cancel it’ll also look like that
[22/8/18, 5:24:27 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: lol
[22/8/18, 5:24:35 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: so we need to add the degree?
[22/8/18, 5:24:44 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i dont know what sin inverse means
[22/8/18, 5:26:03 PM] Yi Kai: sin^-1
[22/8/18, 5:26:07 PM] Yi Kai: No
[22/8/18, 5:26:16 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oh
[22/8/18, 5:26:27 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: kk thanks
‎[23/8/18, 12:36:52 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ‎image omitted
[23/8/18, 12:38:05 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: if i use CuSO4 to find b) the answer will be double that of the given answer because only 1 mol of cuso4 produces 1 mol cuoh, whilst 2 mol of naoh is required
[23/8/18, 6:09:53 AM] Yi Kai: Because naoh is the limiting reagent
[23/8/18, 6:09:56 AM] Yi Kai: Need to state
[23/8/18, 6:13:44 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: wat
[23/8/18, 6:13:48 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: theres not enough space
[23/8/18, 6:16:26 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: and the question doesn't state explicitly that there's a limiting reagent so how do we know
[23/8/18, 6:18:08 AM] Yi Kai: The question didn’t state that anything was in excess. So you need to find which is in excess first
[23/8/18, 6:18:46 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: but it kinda implies that there was no excess
[23/8/18, 6:19:13 AM] Yi Kai: ...
[23/8/18, 6:19:41 AM] Yi Kai: Just find which is in excess. Not very hard anyway
[23/8/18, 6:19:56 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ok thanks
[23/8/18, 8:46:44 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: whats ur answer for math assignment q10
[23/8/18, 8:47:59 PM] Yi Kai: a 40cos^2 tithe units square
b 1/2 sin 2 tithe units square
c pi/2 - tithe - 1/2 sin 2 tithe
[23/8/18, 8:48:29 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: why is there a 40 in a
[23/8/18, 8:48:48 PM] Yi Kai: 4 tithe*
[23/8/18, 8:48:52 PM] Yi Kai: Sorry read wrongly
[23/8/18, 8:48:54 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: for me it was a 2
[23/8/18, 8:49:13 PM] Yi Kai: What’s the full thing?
‎[23/8/18, 8:49:16 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ‎image omitted
[23/8/18, 8:49:18 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: my answers are so different
[23/8/18, 8:50:15 PM] Yi Kai: a: the 2 must also be squared, and tithe at the end can be brought together to become 4 tithe cos ...
[23/8/18, 8:51:04 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: yeah i squared the 2
[23/8/18, 8:51:11 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: but then theres a x0.5
[23/8/18, 8:51:31 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: so it became 2 again
[23/8/18, 8:51:40 PM] Yi Kai: Angle BAD is 2 tithe not tithe
[23/8/18, 8:52:21 PM] Yi Kai: But you can’t tell from your working. Which is why I always make my working like explained answers and assume the teacher to be stupid as much as possible
[23/8/18, 8:52:29 PM] Yi Kai: For part b yours has nothing wrong.
[23/8/18, 8:52:42 PM] Yi Kai: Just that you use AD and AO I used AO and OD
[23/8/18, 8:53:00 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ohh
[23/8/18, 8:53:20 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: but then it means mine has an extra cosine
[23/8/18, 8:53:21 PM] Yi Kai: Since that carries to part c, your part c also nothing wrong
[23/8/18, 8:53:30 PM] Yi Kai: But mine has more numbers
[23/8/18, 8:53:38 PM] Yi Kai: Anyway it doesn’t really matter if you ask me
[23/8/18, 8:53:50 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: hmm ok thanks
[23/8/18, 8:53:58 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: what did u buy for zhouxuan
[23/8/18, 8:54:04 PM] Yi Kai: A speaker
[23/8/18, 8:54:09 PM] Yi Kai: $15
[23/8/18, 8:54:13 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oh
[23/8/18, 8:54:27 PM] Yi Kai: Although the printed price on the box (which I didn’t cover since it’s printed) says $20
[23/8/18, 8:54:27 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: thats quite valur
[23/8/18, 8:54:29 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: value
[23/8/18, 8:54:35 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: lol
[23/8/18, 8:54:37 PM] Yi Kai: But not very loud
[23/8/18, 8:54:53 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: did he want a speaker
[23/8/18, 8:54:56 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: or u chose
[23/8/18, 8:55:00 PM] Yi Kai: He wanted something tech
[23/8/18, 8:55:04 PM] Yi Kai: Or useful
[23/8/18, 8:55:23 PM] Yi Kai: Anyway no gifts are ever that useful. So speaker is useful enough if you ask me
[23/8/18, 8:55:29 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: yeah
[23/8/18, 8:55:32 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: better than a soft toy
[23/8/18, 8:55:56 PM] Yi Kai: Based on his requests I know he doesn’t want soft toy already
[23/8/18, 8:56:08 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: zongjun wanted a soft toy
[23/8/18, 8:56:29 PM] Yi Kai: Lol ok
[23/8/18, 9:03:43 PM] Yi Kai: Did they inform you for anything about becoming AI?
[23/8/18, 9:35:10 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: nope
[23/8/18, 9:35:13 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: is that good or bad
[23/8/18, 10:02:37 PM] Yi Kai: I don’t know
[23/8/18, 10:02:47 PM] Yi Kai: Just asking cause they also never say anything to me
[23/8/18, 10:04:03 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oh
[23/8/18, 10:04:10 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: adriale talked to junwei though
[23/8/18, 10:04:41 PM] Yi Kai: Wow
[23/8/18, 10:04:46 PM] Yi Kai: Why leh?
[23/8/18, 10:04:56 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: he asked him if he was okay with being a sec 3 ai
[23/8/18, 10:05:10 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: then he told junwei to pm him if he doesnt want
[23/8/18, 10:05:31 PM] Yi Kai: Maybe cause he’s most suitable for sec 3 cause he’s like the best among non NCOs
[23/8/18, 10:07:33 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ya
‎[24/8/18, 4:51:29 PM] Yi Kai: ‎image omitted
[24/8/18, 4:51:36 PM] Yi Kai: Tell me if it’s yours
[24/8/18, 6:40:29 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: yes
[29/8/18, 6:58:13 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: lol wth yikai
[29/8/18, 7:10:16 PM] Yi Kai: ?
[29/8/18, 7:10:26 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ur email to julius
[29/8/18, 7:10:34 PM] Yi Kai: That one I'll tell you more tomorrow
[29/8/18, 7:12:14 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: lol ok
[29/8/18, 7:12:56 PM] Yi Kai: Nvm I'll just tell you now
[29/8/18, 7:13:20 PM] Yi Kai: basically I found out a way (with code) to send an email, while manually being able to modify the to, cc, and bcc field
[29/8/18, 7:13:33 PM] Yi Kai: So I just put the to as julius, the bcc as you, but I only sent to you in reality
[29/8/18, 7:13:54 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: wait wtf
[29/8/18, 7:14:05 PM] Yi Kai: The one I did on Bernard was telling tancw that he was gay, then I bcc bernard
[29/8/18, 7:14:18 PM] Yi Kai: I can try one rn if you want
[29/8/18, 7:14:33 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: lol
[29/8/18, 7:14:32 PM] Yi Kai: Like I put the to as you and bcc myself or sth
[29/8/18, 7:14:36 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: what if it really sends
[29/8/18, 7:14:41 PM] Yi Kai: Then gg lorh
[29/8/18, 7:14:49 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oh my
[29/8/18, 7:14:53 PM] Yi Kai: But it's Luna Frankie, and the people I've been sending to don't know who's luna frankie
[29/8/18, 7:15:14 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: but still
[29/8/18, 7:15:18 PM] Yi Kai: But that's what everyone was fussing about yesterday. Like esp Yong Kang and Zhiheng
[29/8/18, 7:15:39 PM] Yi Kai: Tbh Julius won't care one so it's k
[29/8/18, 7:15:46 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ya
[29/8/18, 7:15:50 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: but the tancw one
[29/8/18, 7:16:05 PM] Yi Kai: That one I was quite worried at first
[29/8/18, 7:16:09 PM] Yi Kai: But then it's been 24 hours
[29/8/18, 7:16:12 PM] Yi Kai: And nothing happened
[29/8/18, 7:16:29 PM] Yi Kai: And he checks emails everyday (I presume), esp since it's a working day
[29/8/18, 7:17:38 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: send to me and bcc urself
[29/8/18, 7:17:40 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: see if it sends
[29/8/18, 7:17:45 PM] Yi Kai: Your reply to julius though
[29/8/18, 7:17:51 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: WHAT
[29/8/18, 7:17:56 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i replied to u
[29/8/18, 7:18:01 PM] Yi Kai: Sry oops
[29/8/18, 7:18:15 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: give me heart attack
[29/8/18, 7:18:48 PM] Yi Kai: Just sent
‎[29/8/18, 7:19:29 PM] Yi Kai: ‎image omitted
[29/8/18, 7:19:39 PM] Yi Kai: You shouldn't receive
[29/8/18, 7:19:47 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i didnt receive it
[29/8/18, 7:19:47 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ll
[29/8/18, 7:19:49 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: lol
[29/8/18, 7:19:57 PM] Yi Kai: Supposed to
[29/8/18, 7:20:00 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: scam
[29/8/18, 7:20:12 PM] Yi Kai: I mean like you're not supposed to receive it
[29/8/18, 7:20:20 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ya
[29/8/18, 7:20:20 PM] Yi Kai: As in that's supposed to happen
[29/8/18, 7:20:26 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ik
[29/8/18, 7:20:43 PM] Yi Kai: Well obviously I tried it many times with my many email accounts already, before making use of it
[29/8/18, 7:20:52 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: lol
[29/8/18, 7:20:56 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: what did bernard sat
[29/8/18, 7:20:57 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: sat
[29/8/18, 7:20:58 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: say
[29/8/18, 7:22:01 PM] Yi Kai: He was damn shocked
[29/8/18, 7:22:23 PM] Yi Kai: And he was like are you serious
[29/8/18, 7:23:51 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: LOL
[29/8/18, 7:58:06 PM] Yi Kai: It's a pretty boliao prank but it's quite hard to see through
[29/8/18, 7:58:18 PM] Yi Kai: Like I don't really know what to do with it
[29/8/18, 8:03:02 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oh
[29/8/18, 8:03:39 PM] Yi Kai: I don't feel like doing my hw siah
[29/8/18, 8:03:55 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: same
[29/8/18, 8:04:01 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: theres like 15 worksheets/papers
[29/8/18, 8:40:54 PM] Yi Kai: Sien
[29/8/18, 8:41:03 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: xian
[29/8/18, 8:41:05 PM] Yi Kai: I guess just do the easy ones first. Seems like we need to do 2/3 a day
[29/8/18, 8:41:09 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: yeah
[29/8/18, 8:41:18 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: and like half of it consists of papers
[29/8/18, 8:43:07 PM] Yi Kai: Yah
[29/8/18, 8:43:18 PM] Yi Kai: But must do physics first since simin wants us to do it tomorrow
[29/8/18, 8:43:24 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ya
[29/8/18, 10:53:21 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: hi sec 2 ai
[29/8/18, 10:54:04 PM] Yi Kai: Lol
[29/8/18, 10:54:16 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: sec 2 ais all from ss div
[29/8/18, 10:54:17 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: yay
[29/8/18, 10:54:19 PM] Yi Kai: I don’t know how Avier found out but before this he told me he has the same squad as me
[29/8/18, 10:54:25 PM] Yi Kai: Lol
[29/8/18, 10:54:32 PM] Yi Kai: Sec 2 is desirable
[29/8/18, 10:54:41 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: sike
[29/8/18, 10:54:45 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i wanted sec 1 but ok
[29/8/18, 10:54:49 PM] Yi Kai: At least I can still do the stuff that was in sec 1-3
[29/8/18, 10:54:54 PM] Yi Kai: 1-2*
[29/8/18, 10:54:55 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: at leaste im not zai enough to get forced sec 3
[29/8/18, 10:55:10 PM] Yi Kai: Lol
[29/8/18, 10:55:13 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: what did we do in sec 2
[29/8/18, 10:55:21 PM] Yi Kai: Then you realise all the not zai one in sec one
[29/8/18, 10:55:24 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oh no survival cooking
[29/8/18, 10:55:26 PM] Yi Kai: I forgot tbh
[29/8/18, 10:55:30 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: hey thats not nice
[29/8/18, 10:55:37 PM] Yi Kai: Survival in sec 2 meh? I thought it’s sec 3
[29/8/18, 10:55:45 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: towards the end i think
[29/8/18, 10:55:57 PM] Yi Kai: Well then hope we don’t get activated then
[29/8/18, 10:56:10 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: yes
[29/8/18, 10:56:14 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i wanna pass it though
[29/8/18, 10:56:18 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: but i dont wanna take ssg
[29/8/18, 10:56:32 PM] Yi Kai: Same
[29/8/18, 10:57:16 PM] Yi Kai: Aiyah most of sec 4 squad still CPL so just influence HTD and NCOs to put more survival since it’s the most common reason for failing CAPE
[29/8/18, 10:57:20 PM] Yi Kai: Not tent pitching
[29/8/18, 10:57:32 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: lol
[29/8/18, 10:57:36 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i failed both though
[30/8/18, 6:12:28 AM] Yi Kai: Wow
[30/8/18, 6:12:43 AM] Yi Kai: I thought it’s harder to fail tent pitching?
[30/8/18, 6:15:25 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: yeah
[30/8/18, 6:19:13 AM] Yi Kai: I guess it’s cause I was with Xavier
[30/8/18, 6:19:18 AM] Yi Kai: (Tan)
[30/8/18, 6:19:38 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: dammit
[30/8/18, 6:20:08 AM] Yi Kai: And now I no longer have any zai kia to carry me
[30/8/18, 6:31:16 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: can we give up on 1st class and ssg in sec 4
[30/8/18, 6:36:52 AM] Yi Kai: I think now can already
[30/8/18, 6:37:25 AM] Yi Kai: But might as well go for it when there’s LEAP points for SSG
[30/8/18, 6:37:43 AM] Yi Kai: Why do I smell smoke on the train lol
[30/8/18, 6:39:22 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: wont pass anyways
[30/8/18, 6:39:25 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: lol oops
[30/8/18, 6:40:01 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: meanwhile im still at home
[30/8/18, 6:41:32 AM] Yi Kai: Wot?
[30/8/18, 6:41:42 AM] Yi Kai: I thought you take 45 minutes to reach school?
[30/8/18, 6:42:06 AM] Yi Kai: But in that case why you wake up at like 6.15
[30/8/18, 6:43:00 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i woke up at 6
[30/8/18, 6:43:25 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: yeah but i can reach in time anyways
[30/8/18, 6:53:21 AM] Yi Kai: Wow
[30/8/18, 6:53:32 AM] Yi Kai: Is that your usual timing
[30/8/18, 6:54:11 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: yeah
[30/8/18, 6:54:32 AM] Yi Kai: Wow ok
[30/8/18, 6:55:13 AM] Yi Kai: For me I always wake up at 5.30 and say that I should leave at 6, by I always end up leaving at 6.10 unlike Wenhao who doesn’t bathe in the morning and leaves at 6
[30/8/18, 6:58:11 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oh lol
[30/8/18, 6:58:28 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: im supposed to leave at 630 but i always leave at 640
[30/8/18, 7:03:19 AM] Yi Kai: That’s why you reach so last minute
[30/8/18, 7:10:47 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oops
[30/8/18, 10:03:22 AM] Yi Kai: Are you camping in class?
[30/8/18, 10:45:47 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: nope
[30/8/18, 11:06:31 AM] Yi Kai: What were you doing?
[30/8/18, 11:16:46 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: lol
[30/8/18, 11:16:48 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: math
[30/8/18, 11:16:59 AM] Yi Kai: Where?
[30/8/18, 11:17:42 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: class
[30/8/18, 11:18:13 AM] Yi Kai: Then why you deny
[30/8/18, 11:18:37 AM] Yi Kai: Was like Jia Quan or anyone with you though
[30/8/18, 11:19:51 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: yes
[30/8/18, 11:19:56 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i was at salt when i read ur msg
[30/8/18, 11:20:06 AM] Yi Kai: ...
[30/8/18, 11:20:11 AM] Yi Kai: Who?
[30/8/18, 11:20:26 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: jiaquan
[30/8/18, 11:20:28 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: and people
[30/8/18, 11:20:30 AM] Yi Kai: Cause we realised Jia Quan wasn’t there, then Chen came and wanted to pass him a worksheet to redo
[30/8/18, 11:20:32 AM] Yi Kai: Who?
[30/8/18, 12:13:30 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: why
[30/8/18, 12:18:00 PM] Yi Kai: Just interested
[30/8/18, 12:34:52 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: lol
[30/8/18, 12:35:16 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: junyu and guanlin
[30/8/18, 12:35:44 PM] Yi Kai: Brawling ah?
[30/8/18, 12:36:45 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: math
[30/8/18, 12:36:51 PM] Yi Kai: Wow
[30/8/18, 12:36:55 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ikr
[30/8/18, 12:37:02 PM] Yi Kai: I regret coming back to primary school now
[30/8/18, 12:37:06 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: we may or may not have detracked
[30/8/18, 12:37:09 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: why
[30/8/18, 12:37:17 PM] Yi Kai: Almost none of my classmates came
[30/8/18, 12:37:24 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oh
[30/8/18, 12:37:51 PM] Yi Kai: Like I know some people are in my year but I am not even close to them at all
[30/8/18, 12:38:21 PM] Yi Kai: So I’m like camping at the door hoping to see someone I know come over
[30/8/18, 12:41:16 PM] Yi Kai: Should I just screw it and go home though
[30/8/18, 12:45:43 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: lolyes
[30/8/18, 12:46:24 PM] Yi Kai: I’ll just wait for 5 more minutes
[30/8/18, 12:46:32 PM] Yi Kai: And hope 3S3 terry comes
[30/8/18, 12:46:50 PM] Yi Kai: Actually have but then I do feel like approaching my female classmates
[30/8/18, 12:55:12 PM] Yi Kai: At the same time I’m not 厚脸皮 enough to leave
[30/8/18, 1:00:27 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: lol
[30/8/18, 1:00:29 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: just leave lor
[30/8/18, 1:05:48 PM] Yi Kai: I met almost no one lol
[30/8/18, 1:06:37 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i didnt even go back
[30/8/18, 1:06:52 PM] Yi Kai: Lol
[30/8/18, 1:07:08 PM] Yi Kai: But then I saw some guy who’s like 3 years older go back
[30/8/18, 1:07:27 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: theres only 2 batches before mine
[30/8/18, 1:07:37 PM] Yi Kai: Why?
[30/8/18, 1:07:42 PM] Yi Kai: Your school was new?
[30/8/18, 1:08:26 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: yeah
[30/8/18, 1:09:09 PM] Yi Kai: What’s the school name
[30/8/18, 1:13:23 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: beacon primary school
[30/8/18, 1:17:01 PM] Yi Kai: Wow ok
[30/8/18, 1:17:23 PM] Yi Kai: Is it read as like bi-ken(the malay way) or like bacon
[30/8/18, 1:19:13 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: bee kern
[30/8/18, 1:22:52 PM] Yi Kai: Oh ok
‎[30/8/18, 7:42:13 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ‎image omitted
[30/8/18, 7:42:22 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: like k > 0 should be k < 0
[30/8/18, 7:44:03 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oh wait nvm its correct
‎[3/9/18, 5:07:41 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ‎image omitted
[3/9/18, 5:20:29 PM] Yi Kai: Haven’t do
[3/9/18, 5:27:15 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oh
[3/9/18, 9:59:43 PM] Yi Kai: What did you get?
[3/9/18, 10:00:07 PM] Yi Kai: I found that the relative atomic mass of MO is 7 but that of O is already 16
[3/9/18, 10:02:01 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: whatt
[3/9/18, 10:02:04 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i got 51.2
[3/9/18, 10:02:07 PM] Yi Kai: Oh
[3/9/18, 10:02:09 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: which is close to 50.9
[3/9/18, 10:02:15 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: but idk if its correct
[3/9/18, 10:02:30 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: as in 51.2 is the relative atomic mass of M
[3/9/18, 10:02:34 PM] Yi Kai: Oh
[3/9/18, 10:02:42 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: isnt it MO2 though
[3/9/18, 10:02:55 PM] Yi Kai: No...
[3/9/18, 10:03:11 PM] Yi Kai: M can be 2+?
[3/9/18, 10:03:10 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oh wait
[3/9/18, 10:03:16 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i confused with another question
‎[3/9/18, 10:03:53 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ‎image omitted
[3/9/18, 10:05:29 PM] Yi Kai: Just realised a mistake but mine is still like 56
[3/9/18, 10:05:43 PM] Yi Kai: Like 55.9, which is iron
[3/9/18, 10:06:16 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ah
[3/9/18, 10:06:28 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: how is ur working diff from mine
[3/9/18, 10:07:00 PM] Yi Kai: I didn’t use concentration
[3/9/18, 10:07:04 PM] Yi Kai: It’s damn messy
‎[3/9/18, 10:07:21 PM] Yi Kai: ‎image omitted
[3/9/18, 10:07:26 PM] Yi Kai: Pardon the handwriting
[3/9/18, 10:07:52 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: why multiply 100/25
[3/9/18, 10:08:29 PM] Yi Kai: Because I know the number of mol of sulfuric acid in 25cm^3
[3/9/18, 10:08:50 PM] Yi Kai: To know the number of mol in 100cm^3 I just times 4
[3/9/18, 10:10:50 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: 0.05500 mol of h2so4 is the excess one or the reacted one
[3/9/18, 10:11:00 PM] Yi Kai: Excess
[3/9/18, 10:12:09 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i dont see anything wrong with my working though
[3/9/18, 10:12:16 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: but your answer looks more correct
[3/9/18, 10:14:17 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: 25cm3 of h2so4 is 0.005500 mol
[3/9/18, 10:14:27 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: is it ok to times 4 to get mol of 100cm3
[3/9/18, 10:15:02 PM] Yi Kai: You mean 100cm3?
[3/9/18, 10:15:11 PM] Yi Kai: Why not though
[3/9/18, 10:15:28 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: isnt it 25
[3/9/18, 10:15:36 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: cus idk what mol means
[3/9/18, 10:16:17 PM] Yi Kai: Ok so you ignore the 100cm3
[3/9/18, 10:16:42 PM] Yi Kai: It’s basically the number of molecules divided by Avogadro constant
[3/9/18, 10:17:41 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oh wait it is
[3/9/18, 10:17:50 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i meant 0.00137t
[3/9/18, 10:17:51 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: 5
[3/9/18, 10:17:55 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: help
[3/9/18, 10:18:05 PM] Yi Kai: What?
[3/9/18, 10:18:19 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i dun get it
[3/9/18, 10:19:27 PM] Yi Kai: But you can’t just use concentration cause the reaction produces water
[3/9/18, 10:19:47 PM] Yi Kai: MO+H2SO4 gives H2O + MSO4
[3/9/18, 10:22:16 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: but it only concerns the left side of the equation
[3/9/18, 10:22:33 PM] Yi Kai: ?
[3/9/18, 10:23:25 PM] Yi Kai: And also the volume changes from 30 to 100cm3
[3/9/18, 10:31:31 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oh crap
[3/9/18, 10:31:34 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: that makes sense
‎[4/9/18, 12:30:02 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ‎image omitted
[4/9/18, 12:31:08 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: why all the intermediate steps will cause an increase in the amount of solution needed to convert Fe2+ to Fe3+
[4/9/18, 12:50:02 PM] Yi Kai: Hang on I’m still out lol
[4/9/18, 12:54:27 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ok
[4/9/18, 3:43:58 PM] Yi Kai: Wait the whole food committee for W6 bought a tie right?
[4/9/18, 3:44:27 PM] Yi Kai: Cause I’m saying that I didn’t bring a tie for today’s SMP event and my parents are like “you don’t have one”
[4/9/18, 3:44:45 PM] Yi Kai: But then I can’t find my tie so it’s damn retarded
[4/9/18, 3:47:50 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: everyone had a tie what
[4/9/18, 3:47:54 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: except me and yuxing
[4/9/18, 3:47:55 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oops
[4/9/18, 4:00:46 PM] Yi Kai: Wow ok
[4/9/18, 4:00:55 PM] Yi Kai: Sigh I just can’t find my tie
[4/9/18, 4:01:23 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: lol
[4/9/18, 4:01:34 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: u went without a tie?
[4/9/18, 4:01:49 PM] Yi Kai: Chiakp told us that today don’t need tie
[4/9/18, 4:02:26 PM] Yi Kai: But pehyk told her groups need tie, and all my group members brought just in case, so I became the only one without a tie. In the end I borrowed one from the others when I was presenting
[4/9/18, 4:03:09 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oh
[4/9/18, 4:06:48 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: btw if the number of mol is exact do u have to still leave it in 4sf for intermidiate steps
[4/9/18, 4:07:04 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: is do u just leave it in 3sf as final answer even if the actual answer is 2 sf
[4/9/18, 4:07:09 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: like 0.042
[4/9/18, 4:10:52 PM] Yi Kai: Yes, quite stupid
[4/9/18, 4:11:14 PM] Yi Kai: Yes, 0.042 will be 0.0420
[4/9/18, 4:11:25 PM] Yi Kai: Anyway I haven’t do that question
[4/9/18, 4:11:33 PM] Yi Kai: Why you do holiday homework so first one lol
[4/9/18, 4:14:08 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: she posted answers alr lol
[4/9/18, 4:14:11 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i just realised
[4/9/18, 4:14:13 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: fast meh
[4/9/18, 4:14:20 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i have been overseas since friday
[4/9/18, 4:16:12 PM] Yi Kai: Well fast enough to me
[4/9/18, 4:16:29 PM] Yi Kai: Maybe cause I keep spending my time on tuition homework which gives me no progress
[4/9/18, 4:16:38 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oh lol
[4/9/18, 4:16:41 PM] Yi Kai: And I also keep slacking, even yesterday
[4/9/18, 4:16:54 PM] Yi Kai: Have you done business proposal?
[4/9/18, 4:17:00 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i did 3 worksheets on the plane
[4/9/18, 4:17:03 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ya
[4/9/18, 4:17:09 PM] Yi Kai: Wow where you go so far one
[4/9/18, 4:17:11 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i didnt get extension of early bird deadline

[4/9/18, 4:17:22 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: whens ur deadline
[4/9/18, 4:17:28 PM] Yi Kai: Same, so I gave up on that
[4/9/18, 4:17:40 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: as in
[4/9/18, 4:17:45 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: extend by 1 week
[4/9/18, 4:17:54 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i thought u were one of the last group
[4/9/18, 4:17:55 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: s
[4/9/18, 4:17:55 PM] Yi Kai: Mine’s the same as yours, so I gave up on the deadline
[4/9/18, 4:17:58 PM] Yi Kai: Yes
[4/9/18, 4:18:00 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: so u got 1 week later
[4/9/18, 4:18:03 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ohh
[4/9/18, 4:18:04 PM] Yi Kai: That’s why I’m quite salty
[4/9/18, 4:18:08 PM] Yi Kai: I’m in week 9
[4/9/18, 4:18:08 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: LOL
[4/9/18, 4:18:16 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: just bs it
[4/9/18, 4:18:22 PM] Yi Kai: Fair enough
[4/9/18, 4:18:37 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: logs is hard
[4/9/18, 4:18:44 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: spring cleaning is hard
[4/9/18, 4:18:48 PM] Yi Kai: The concentration of hydrogen ions used in pH is mol per dm3 right?
[4/9/18, 4:18:56 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: yes
[4/9/18, 4:19:01 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: can it be g dm-3 though
[4/9/18, 4:19:05 PM] Yi Kai: I haven’t done anything for pubs, cause I don’t know how to use the github desktop
[4/9/18, 4:19:08 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: and how do u calculate ph of NaOH
[4/9/18, 4:19:11 PM] Yi Kai: Unlikely though
[4/9/18, 4:19:21 PM] Yi Kai: I also dk
[4/9/18, 4:19:25 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: manage instagram
[4/9/18, 4:19:27 PM] Yi Kai: I’m still on page 3 q6
[4/9/18, 4:19:33 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oh
[4/9/18, 4:19:37 PM] Yi Kai: That one done by Avier
[4/9/18, 4:19:44 PM] Yi Kai: And I don’t know the Insta password
[4/9/18, 4:19:51 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oops
[4/9/18, 4:20:54 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: what hw dl u have left
[4/9/18, 4:22:07 PM] Yi Kai: Chem calculations, acid based QA, physics wave worksheet, math assignment, business proposal and all the exam papers
[4/9/18, 4:23:44 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oh
[4/9/18, 4:23:51 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: what math assignment
‎[4/9/18, 4:24:08 PM] Yi Kai: ‎image omitted
[4/9/18, 4:24:33 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oh that
[4/9/18, 4:54:56 PM] Yi Kai: I wanted to say that there’s no distractions on the plane so it’s easier, but I realised that there’s usually games on the plane which I always play
[4/9/18, 4:59:05 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: LOL
[4/9/18, 4:59:08 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i dont tho
[4/9/18, 4:59:35 PM] Yi Kai: Finally at that question. It j also don’t understand
[4/9/18, 4:59:37 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: the only thing i played on the plane was reversi
[4/9/18, 4:59:43 PM] Yi Kai: Wow
[4/9/18, 5:00:00 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: cus only Fe2+ reacts with MnO4
[4/9/18, 5:00:35 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: at first only the fe2+ reacts, but at the end all the fe2+ is converted to fe3+
[4/9/18, 6:02:39 PM] Yi Kai: Erm do we need to do the 论坛 wangdk posted on google classroom
[4/9/18, 6:02:50 PM] Yi Kai: It says it's due on friday, but I don't remember him saying anything about it
[4/9/18, 6:02:56 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i think so
[4/9/18, 6:03:04 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: idk if people are gonna do though
[4/9/18, 6:03:07 PM] Yi Kai: Plus there's supposed to be a math practice paper, just that I'm very happy to not receive it
[4/9/18, 6:03:14 PM] Yi Kai: Bernard already doing
[4/9/18, 6:03:10 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: yeah he didnt
[4/9/18, 6:03:18 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: wait what practice paper
[4/9/18, 6:03:34 PM] Yi Kai: Wait don't have?
[4/9/18, 6:03:53 PM] Yi Kai: 'Cause Yiqin said that there was one given out on wednesday when I wasn't in school, but luckily I wasn't there to receive it
[4/9/18, 6:04:06 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: huhh
[4/9/18, 6:04:09 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i dont have one
[4/9/18, 6:04:18 PM] Yi Kai: Ok then nvm
[4/9/18, 6:04:25 PM] Yi Kai: Ok great just finished chem calc
[4/9/18, 6:04:33 PM] Yi Kai: What have you finished/not finished though

[4/9/18, 6:06:24 PM] Yi Kai: Don't count el project
[4/9/18, 6:06:40 PM] Yi Kai: Was there an ss worksheet? And for physics and chem why you have so many one?
[4/9/18, 6:06:51 PM] Yi Kai: Is it the practice papers?
[4/9/18, 6:08:35 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: yes
[4/9/18, 6:08:42 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: cohen posted something on Google classroom
[4/9/18, 6:10:07 PM] Yi Kai: Oh
[4/9/18, 6:10:49 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: idk if we need to do though
[4/9/18, 6:11:21 PM] Yi Kai: True
[4/9/18, 6:32:43 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: wait what China thing are u talking about
[4/9/18, 6:40:31 PM] Yi Kai: I’m going Beijing
[4/9/18, 6:40:40 PM] Yi Kai: And they ask me to fill up a form for visa application
[4/9/18, 6:40:53 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ooh
[4/9/18, 6:40:57 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: why i don't have
[4/9/18, 6:41:17 PM] Yi Kai: I don’t know
[4/9/18, 6:41:21 PM] Yi Kai: They inform by email
[4/9/18, 6:41:30 PM] Yi Kai: And they’ll SMS you to check email
[4/9/18, 6:45:28 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oh
[5/9/18, 10:56:18 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: did u mug for tmrs test
[5/9/18, 10:56:32 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i just finished bathing after returning home from overseas
[5/9/18, 10:56:42 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: and im not sure if its worth the effort to mug now
[5/9/18, 10:57:04 PM] Yi Kai: I mixed mugging and slacking for the whole day
[5/9/18, 10:57:10 PM] Yi Kai: QA easier to mug
[5/9/18, 10:57:21 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: qa cancer actually
[5/9/18, 10:57:34 PM] Yi Kai: Mug first page and the rest will make sense
[5/9/18, 10:57:42 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: huh
[5/9/18, 10:57:51 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: what first page
[5/9/18, 10:57:57 PM] Yi Kai: First page tells the general colour of a salt given the cation
[5/9/18, 10:58:11 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oh
[5/9/18, 10:58:17 PM] Yi Kai: And this will tell the colour of the ppt when reacted with sodium hydroxide or aqueous ammonia
[5/9/18, 10:58:30 PM] Yi Kai: Then I visualise the chart to know whether it's soluble in excess
[5/9/18, 10:58:52 PM] Yi Kai: Cancer one is the gas test for sulfur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide
[5/9/18, 10:58:55 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: tbh i dont mind remedial
[5/9/18, 10:58:59 PM] Yi Kai: ...
[5/9/18, 10:59:03 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: yes
[5/9/18, 10:59:08 PM] Yi Kai: I want to mug, 'cause I want my exemption
[5/9/18, 10:59:18 PM] Yi Kai: But that's only 2 things
[5/9/18, 10:59:18 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i have no exemption anyways
[5/9/18, 10:59:33 PM] Yi Kai: Have you had any in sec 1 sec 2?
[5/9/18, 10:59:39 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: yeah
[5/9/18, 10:59:47 PM] Yi Kai: Tbh you should have mugged on the plane instead of doing hw
[5/9/18, 10:59:58 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i did the chem practice paper
[5/9/18, 11:00:01 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: does that count as mugging
[5/9/18, 11:00:10 PM] Yi Kai: Chem calc mostly makes sense so I don't bother memorising equations liao
[5/9/18, 11:00:42 PM] Yi Kai: Fair enough. At 8pm I was like ok I want to do this, then  was like, but I don't want finish so late, nvm give up do another worksheet
[5/9/18, 11:00:40 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: chem calc is easy after u do a lot of questions
[5/9/18, 11:00:41 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: which she gave
[5/9/18, 11:00:52 PM] Yi Kai: Yah
[5/9/18, 11:01:01 PM] Yi Kai: I find pehyk quite good actually
[5/9/18, 11:01:56 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: lol
[5/9/18, 11:02:01 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: but shes very fast
[5/9/18, 11:02:06 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: its stressful
[5/9/18, 11:02:11 PM] Yi Kai: Still ok if you finish her worksheets
[5/9/18, 11:02:15 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ip classes havent learn atmosphere yet
[5/9/18, 11:02:18 PM] Yi Kai: True
[5/9/18, 11:02:22 PM] Yi Kai: Wow...
[5/9/18, 11:02:23 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i didnt for like half of term 3 though
[5/9/18, 11:02:29 PM] Yi Kai: ...
[5/9/18, 11:02:37 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: cus all my homework rolled over from june holidays
[5/9/18, 11:02:41 PM] Yi Kai: At least don't have extra lessons, if not damn sien
[5/9/18, 11:02:45 PM] Yi Kai: 😂
[5/9/18, 11:02:48 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i basically had 4 days to do stuff in june
[5/9/18, 11:02:54 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ahem remedial
[5/9/18, 11:02:59 PM] Yi Kai: Why?
[5/9/18, 11:03:12 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: unit camp
[5/9/18, 11:03:12 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: pir
[5/9/18, 11:03:20 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: then i was overseas
[5/9/18, 11:03:22 PM] Yi Kai: Rudy lee extra lessons more than pehyk remedial
[5/9/18, 11:03:25 PM] Yi Kai: Oh
[5/9/18, 11:03:31 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: rlly
[5/9/18, 11:03:36 PM] Yi Kai: Yes...
[5/9/18, 11:03:46 PM] Yi Kai: I heard there was 6hrs of lesson on Monday
[5/9/18, 11:03:57 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: wth
[7/9/18, 9:04:02 AM] Yi Kai: Should I accept Edison’s mum into the fb group
[7/9/18, 9:04:12 AM] Yi Kai: Cause she’s not exactly in HCINPCC
[7/9/18, 9:04:29 AM] Yi Kai: But if I want to accept her, I don’t know why but her account legit has no friends
[7/9/18, 11:47:18 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: lol
[7/9/18, 11:47:29 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: in the past do u accept parents
[7/9/18, 3:22:45 PM] Yi Kai: I mean I only got into the group recently
[7/9/18, 3:22:58 PM] Yi Kai: And I have only rejected random people before
[7/9/18, 3:23:04 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oh
[7/9/18, 3:23:09 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ask weikiat or smth lor
[7/9/18, 3:23:49 PM] Yi Kai: Ok
[7/9/18, 11:18:18 PM] Yi Kai: Did you go for early bird?
[7/9/18, 11:18:30 PM] Yi Kai: 'Cause I feel like I'm the only group which didn't
[7/9/18, 11:29:48 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: yeah
[9/9/18, 7:03:42 PM] Yi Kai: Freak just realised that maumu go and cc adriale in his zam email reply to malcolm
[9/9/18, 7:07:11 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: why though
[9/9/18, 7:07:40 PM] Yi Kai: Did you read the email?
[9/9/18, 7:07:51 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: yeah
[9/9/18, 7:07:53 PM] Yi Kai: I think it's too show adriale his batch failed in making us responsible or sth stupid
[9/9/18, 7:08:09 PM] Yi Kai: No need to do the math retest paper right? 'Cause for math that's the only thing I didn't do
[9/9/18, 7:08:42 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: yeah i think so
[9/9/18, 7:08:44 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: wth
[9/9/18, 7:09:25 PM] Yi Kai: I mean like that's the only thing I can think of?
[9/9/18, 7:09:31 PM] Yi Kai: Other than malcolm who was there though
[9/9/18, 7:09:42 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: xavier edison
[9/9/18, 7:09:56 PM] Yi Kai: Oh
[9/9/18, 7:16:14 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: what hw do u have left
[9/9/18, 7:16:21 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i have like 3 physics 1 chem
[9/9/18, 7:16:52 PM] Yi Kai: I am happy to say that I finished 1 physics, so I have 2 physics 2 chem left
[9/9/18, 7:17:16 PM] Yi Kai: I'll probably do paper 1 of chem today, then do paper 2 tomorrow after school
[9/9/18, 7:17:29 PM] Yi Kai: Then I should be safe for some time already
[9/9/18, 7:21:02 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oh
[9/9/18, 7:21:06 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ill try to do 2 physics today
[9/9/18, 7:21:09 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: but not that possible
[9/9/18, 7:21:10 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: lol
[9/9/18, 7:21:16 PM] Yi Kai: Yah
[9/9/18, 7:21:24 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: considering i was slacking for the past 2 days
[9/9/18, 7:21:29 PM] Yi Kai: How much of paper A have you done?
[9/9/18, 7:21:44 PM] Yi Kai: 'Cause paper 1 45 mins, paper 2 1hr 45 mins, so you need at least 2.5 hours
[9/9/18, 7:22:02 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: until page 8
[9/9/18, 7:22:51 PM] Yi Kai: Ok then it's a bit more possible
[9/9/18, 7:22:57 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: just that i dont know how to do anything so i take a really long time to do
[9/9/18, 7:22:58 PM] Yi Kai: Just set a timer for yourself, then you will finish on time
[9/9/18, 7:23:15 PM] Yi Kai: What do you go and reference?
[9/9/18, 7:23:23 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i dont know what to write cause  i forgot everything anyways
[9/9/18, 7:23:39 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ya
[9/9/18, 7:25:34 PM] Yi Kai: I mean like you find textbook, notes or internet?
[9/9/18, 7:26:04 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: worksheets and internet
[9/9/18, 7:31:48 PM] Yi Kai: Wow ok lol
[9/9/18, 7:31:59 PM] Yi Kai: For me I never really forget my physics stuff
[9/9/18, 7:32:07 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: how
[9/9/18, 7:32:10 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i forget like everything
[9/9/18, 7:32:11 PM] Yi Kai: At most I'll just try to re-derive whatever I forgot
[9/9/18, 7:32:17 PM] Yi Kai: 'Cause they make sense to me
[9/9/18, 7:32:25 PM] Yi Kai: And unlike chem, there isn't a standard explanation
[9/9/18, 7:32:35 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: lol
[9/9/18, 7:32:39 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: good lor
[9/9/18, 7:32:41 PM] Yi Kai: It's sth like what I do for math actually
[9/9/18, 7:33:16 PM] Yi Kai: But my concept also not that strong anymore so I asked class chat
[9/9/18, 7:33:33 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oh
[9/9/18, 7:34:09 PM] Yi Kai: Ok eating dinner bye
[9/9/18, 7:34:18 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: byee
[9/9/18, 7:56:46 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: um fong hasnt returned us our worksheets
[9/9/18, 8:10:30 PM] Yi Kai: True
[9/9/18, 8:10:42 PM] Yi Kai: Did you self mark your worksheets from Ng?
‎[9/9/18, 8:10:56 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ‎image omitted
[9/9/18, 8:10:58 PM] Yi Kai: Like one term ago she posted answers but I didn’t bother
[9/9/18, 8:11:01 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: which worksheets
[9/9/18, 8:11:06 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i think i did
[9/9/18, 8:11:19 PM] Yi Kai: Increase surface area, so transfer heat to air faster
[9/9/18, 8:11:31 PM] Yi Kai: Then the air to air will be convection
[9/9/18, 8:11:32 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: but isnt that for radiation
[9/9/18, 8:11:37 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: like the surface area as a factor
[9/9/18, 8:11:47 PM] Yi Kai: It was like Newton’s laws
[9/9/18, 8:11:54 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: yeah i did
[9/9/18, 8:11:54 PM] Yi Kai: Hmm maybe
[9/9/18, 8:12:11 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: but the fins are solid though
[9/9/18, 8:12:12 PM] Yi Kai: Plus the black fins is also supposed to help only for radiation
[9/9/18, 8:12:16 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: so idk why convection
[9/9/18, 8:12:27 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: radiation makes more sense
[9/9/18, 8:12:29 PM] Yi Kai: That’s why I leave it for air to air
[9/9/18, 8:12:34 PM] Yi Kai: Lol I agree
[9/9/18, 8:12:38 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: air to air?
[9/9/18, 8:13:12 PM] Yi Kai: Convection within air
[9/9/18, 8:13:28 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: but then it doesnt concern fins already
[9/9/18, 8:13:35 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: lol the question is weird
[9/9/18, 8:13:46 PM] Yi Kai: Transfer the heat away?
[9/9/18, 8:14:10 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: huh
[9/9/18, 8:14:47 PM] Yi Kai: I don’t know lah
[9/9/18, 8:15:05 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: lol nvm i just answer radiation way
[9/9/18, 8:15:11 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: but i replace radiation with convection
[9/9/18, 8:15:24 PM] Yi Kai: Wta
[9/9/18, 8:16:35 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: wta
[9/9/18, 9:35:01 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: how to find force needed for acceleration
[9/9/18, 9:35:32 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: can it be in joules
[9/9/18, 9:39:38 PM] Yi Kai: Force is in Newtons...
[9/9/18, 9:39:46 PM] Yi Kai: Maybe use f=ma?
‎[9/9/18, 9:41:18 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ‎image omitted
[9/9/18, 9:42:01 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: cus u cant really find kinetic energu
[9/9/18, 9:45:14 PM] Yi Kai: Just find like power times time?
[9/9/18, 9:45:36 PM] Yi Kai: Actually why I use mgh for first ten seconds ah
[9/9/18, 9:45:48 PM] Yi Kai: Second part I use force times work done
[9/9/18, 9:45:57 PM] Yi Kai: Force times displacement
[9/9/18, 9:48:08 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i got like
[9/9/18, 9:48:16 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: 74440J energy required
[9/9/18, 10:32:59 PM] Yi Kai: Yah same around there
[9/9/18, 10:33:08 PM] Yi Kai: Then the efficiency less than 0.05 percent
[9/9/18, 10:33:36 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: wait now i got 1.9 MJ
[9/9/18, 10:34:03 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: cus u constantly need a minimum lift force of 5800N throughout the 325 seconds
[9/9/18, 10:34:25 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: then u calculate kinetic energy required to accelerate the balloon
[9/9/18, 10:34:36 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: which is .5mv^2
[10/9/18, 6:18:50 AM] Yi Kai: Wait isn’t it 7110?
[10/9/18, 6:19:13 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: wth
[10/9/18, 6:21:07 AM] Yi Kai: Nvm compare in school
[10/9/18, 6:21:29 AM] Yi Kai: Cause if you add up all the masses plus the four people I got 711.0 kg
[10/9/18, 6:21:50 AM] Yi Kai: Then multiplied by gravitational acceleration 10ms-2 I get 7110N
[10/9/18, 6:45:23 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: lol i only did 3 people
[10/9/18, 6:45:29 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: but the math still doesnt add up
[10/9/18, 6:52:41 AM] Yi Kai: Wot?
[10/9/18, 6:52:45 AM] Yi Kai: ^
[10/9/18, 6:53:14 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ok
[10/9/18, 7:00:09 PM] Yi Kai: Any idea what’s with AnA on the promotion tests though
[10/9/18, 7:00:23 PM] Yi Kai: How is 8 subjects a lot of academic commitments.
[10/9/18, 7:00:28 PM] Yi Kai: ...
[10/9/18, 7:01:50 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: lol i think maumu dont want parents to complain
[10/9/18, 7:01:51 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: cause of cape in term 4
[10/9/18, 7:02:01 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: for cos^3(x) = -1/8 is it no solution?
[10/9/18, 7:02:41 PM] Yi Kai: Maybe
[10/9/18, 7:02:51 PM] Yi Kai: True, when CCA supposed to end Liao
[10/9/18, 7:03:20 PM] Yi Kai: Didn’t do yet, but if you cube root both sides, cos x =-1/2
[10/9/18, 7:03:24 PM] Yi Kai: If you use calculator
[10/9/18, 7:03:47 PM] Yi Kai: Cause I’m on my way home from tuition
[10/9/18, 7:03:57 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: cause like
[10/9/18, 7:04:01 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: the answer is 120 or smth
[10/9/18, 7:04:07 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: but then the range is 180 to 360
[10/9/18, 7:04:18 PM] Yi Kai: Wot?
[10/9/18, 7:04:23 PM] Yi Kai: Mod 360?
‎[10/9/18, 7:04:36 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ‎image omitted
[10/9/18, 7:05:05 PM] Yi Kai: Use ASTC
[10/9/18, 7:05:22 PM] Yi Kai: So if it’s negative it can be in third quadrant which will be in the range
[10/9/18, 7:06:07 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: wait wot
[10/9/18, 7:06:13 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: then how to show working
[10/9/18, 7:06:35 PM] Yi Kai: Easiest way it to draw I Guess
[10/9/18, 7:06:51 PM] Yi Kai: Cause if it’s 4th quadrant cosine value can’t be negative
[10/9/18, 7:07:12 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: then calculation way doesnt work ah
[10/9/18, 7:07:40 PM] Yi Kai: Cosine inverse will just give you the smallest possible positive angle that will give the ratio
[10/9/18, 7:07:46 PM] Yi Kai: In some way yes
[10/9/18, 7:08:11 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ohh
[10/9/18, 7:08:16 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: wth this is scam
[10/9/18, 7:08:58 PM] Yi Kai: You can say like based on range x is in 3rd or 4th quadrant
[10/9/18, 7:09:12 PM] Yi Kai: Then say that since cosine value is negative it’s in 3rd quadrant
[10/9/18, 7:09:31 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ok thanks
[10/9/18, 7:09:45 PM] Yi Kai: Don’t need to do yet right?
[10/9/18, 7:09:56 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: wait i thought need do by tmr
[10/9/18, 7:09:59 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: maybe i wasnt listening
[10/9/18, 7:10:58 PM] Yi Kai: Ok lol
[10/9/18, 7:11:09 PM] Yi Kai: But if this is the last then what about trigo graphs though
[10/9/18, 7:11:16 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: last what
[10/9/18, 7:11:43 PM] Yi Kai: Last topic
[10/9/18, 7:11:55 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: this is last topic?
[10/9/18, 7:12:13 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i thought he said last worksheet before he start on a new topic
[10/9/18, 7:12:15 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: no idea
[10/9/18, 7:13:39 PM] Yi Kai: Oh yah maybe
[10/9/18, 7:13:56 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: what about cot and sec thing
[10/9/18, 7:14:55 PM] Yi Kai: That one iSpark learnt last year so I don’t care
[10/9/18, 7:14:59 PM] Yi Kai: Anyway it’s damn easy
[10/9/18, 7:15:12 PM] Yi Kai: It’s just the reciprocal of the result of another trigo function
[10/9/18, 7:15:23 PM] Yi Kai: Like 1/(sin A)
‎[10/9/18, 7:27:33 PM] Yi Kai: ‎image omitted
[10/9/18, 7:28:12 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: LOL
[10/9/18, 7:28:25 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i probably failed everythint
[10/9/18, 7:28:29 PM] Yi Kai: Haha same
[10/9/18, 8:07:28 PM] Yi Kai: Should I take CAPE?
[10/9/18, 8:07:38 PM] Yi Kai: Cause I honestly don’t see the purpose in it
[10/9/18, 8:09:42 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: why not
[10/9/18, 8:11:14 PM] Yi Kai: Cause I’ll probably not pass
[10/9/18, 8:11:22 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: why
[10/9/18, 8:11:27 PM] Yi Kai: Especially since there’s no training at all
[10/9/18, 8:11:31 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: tbh same but i want to go for fun
[10/9/18, 8:11:39 PM] Yi Kai: When was the last time we had training on survival cooking
[10/9/18, 8:11:46 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: lol no idea
[10/9/18, 8:12:09 PM] Yi Kai: I only remember 2 times, once the test I failed and the other one for the one for optional training
[10/9/18, 8:12:34 PM] Yi Kai: And my boiling honestly cannot make it one, and it’s not something NCOs can help me to do
[10/9/18, 8:12:43 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: same tbh
[10/9/18, 8:12:46 PM] Yi Kai: If it doesn’t boil they can’t say it boiled
[10/9/18, 8:12:54 PM] Yi Kai: It’s not subjective
[10/9/18, 8:14:52 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: did u get the mess tin onto the stove
[10/9/18, 8:18:35 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i think you should just go
[10/9/18, 8:18:47 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: take it as experience
[10/9/18, 8:18:57 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: tbh after i pass sgt i wont want to go for ssg anymore
[10/9/18, 9:04:05 PM] Yi Kai: No
[10/9/18, 9:04:08 PM] Yi Kai: Same
[10/9/18, 9:07:27 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i hope we can opt out
[10/9/18, 9:41:35 PM] Yi Kai: Lol probably
[10/9/18, 9:42:14 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: yay

[11/9/18, 6:14:33 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: cus if u take it out the angles are in different quadrants
[11/9/18, 6:20:53 AM] Yi Kai: Yes it matters
[11/9/18, 6:21:27 AM] Yi Kai: Cause it changes the quadrant (or range since I didn’t draw diagram for all questions)
[11/9/18, 6:21:53 AM] Yi Kai: So the smallest possible value is like 270 or -90 but that’s out of range
[11/9/18, 6:22:22 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: yeah i got this
[11/9/18, 6:22:35 AM] Yi Kai: No solution lorh
[11/9/18, 6:22:40 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: really ah
[11/9/18, 6:22:46 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i got siked by class chat
[11/9/18, 6:22:57 AM] Yi Kai: What did they say, I didn’t read lol
[11/9/18, 6:23:12 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: they say its 90 degrees
[11/9/18, 6:23:21 AM] Yi Kai: Bruh
[11/9/18, 6:23:26 AM] Yi Kai: -x is 90
[11/9/18, 6:23:31 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: yeah
[11/9/18, 10:07:57 PM] Yi Kai: I don’t want to go optional training lol
[11/9/18, 10:10:43 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: why
[11/9/18, 10:10:47 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: try to pass
[11/9/18, 10:10:54 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i believe u can
[11/9/18, 10:11:03 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: unlike me i also failed tent
[11/9/18, 10:12:06 PM] Yi Kai: I can if I go
[11/9/18, 10:12:09 PM] Yi Kai: But I’m just lazy
[11/9/18, 10:12:14 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: then goo
[11/9/18, 10:12:21 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: actually idk
[11/9/18, 10:12:29 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: im not rlly motivated to take ssg
[11/9/18, 10:13:00 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: and also i have chem remedial tmr apparently
[11/9/18, 10:13:05 PM] Yi Kai: Oh
[11/9/18, 10:13:09 PM] Yi Kai: 1.30?
[11/9/18, 10:13:14 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: no idea
[11/9/18, 10:13:19 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: why is sow so kiasu
[11/9/18, 10:13:27 PM] Yi Kai: Cause it’s SMTP
[11/9/18, 10:13:33 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: maumu isnt that kiasu
[11/9/18, 10:13:39 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: neither is ang
[11/9/18, 10:13:43 PM] Yi Kai: And our class is actually quite good for chem compared to other classes
[11/9/18, 10:13:51 PM] Yi Kai: Angcc or anglc?
[11/9/18, 10:13:55 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: excluding me
[11/9/18, 10:13:58 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: sh
[11/9/18, 10:14:02 PM] Yi Kai: Generally
[11/9/18, 10:14:07 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oops
[11/9/18, 10:14:08 PM] Yi Kai: Oh
[11/9/18, 10:14:14 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: maybe its just that i dont mug
[11/9/18, 10:14:18 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: and i need the mugging
[11/9/18, 10:14:27 PM] Yi Kai: That one is very true anyway
[11/9/18, 10:14:32 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ya
[11/9/18, 10:14:41 PM] Yi Kai: For exam or just this quiz?
[11/9/18, 10:14:45 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: now we have a potential of 4.5h of chem per week
[11/9/18, 10:14:54 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ct2 and the quiz
[11/9/18, 10:15:00 PM] Yi Kai: She won’t want to stay so late on Tuesday
[11/9/18, 10:15:04 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: lol
[11/9/18, 10:15:08 PM] Yi Kai: How can you not Mug for ct...
[11/9/18, 10:15:15 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i didnt have time
[11/9/18, 10:15:19 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: for some reason
[11/9/18, 10:15:24 PM] Yi Kai: ...
[11/9/18, 10:15:27 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i think i was too tired
[11/9/18, 10:15:40 PM] Yi Kai: One day can Mug finish everything for chem for one CT tbh
[11/9/18, 10:15:52 PM] Yi Kai: But if you split into multiple small sessions it’s better
[11/9/18, 10:15:55 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i didnt even have 2 hours i think
[11/9/18, 10:16:01 PM] Yi Kai: How...
[11/9/18, 10:16:04 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i need to sleep more
[11/9/18, 10:16:07 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: too tired
[11/9/18, 10:16:13 PM] Yi Kai: I take what you take
[11/9/18, 10:16:14 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: then not productive
[11/9/18, 10:16:18 PM] Yi Kai: What time you sleep?
[11/9/18, 10:16:20 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: so i just go sleep amyways
[11/9/18, 10:16:25 PM] Yi Kai: I make sure I stop work by 10.15
[11/9/18, 10:16:25 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: like 12
[11/9/18, 10:16:30 PM] Yi Kai: Bruh
[11/9/18, 10:16:30 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: or sometimes latet
[11/9/18, 10:16:41 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: its 1016 now
[11/9/18, 10:16:44 PM] Yi Kai: Logically you have as much or more time than Mr lah
[11/9/18, 10:16:49 PM] Yi Kai: Yah I stop work alr
[11/9/18, 10:16:51 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: yeah
[11/9/18, 10:17:03 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: hope i dont die for eoy
[11/9/18, 10:17:05 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: if i do
[11/9/18, 10:17:08 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: it will be sad
[11/9/18, 10:17:11 PM] Yi Kai: You won’t probably
[11/9/18, 10:17:18 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: it should be easier right
[11/9/18, 10:17:22 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: cus normal paper
[11/9/18, 10:17:28 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: and eoy usually is easier
[11/9/18, 10:17:34 PM] Yi Kai: Probably
[11/9/18, 10:17:42 PM] Yi Kai: But my grades all damn miracle
[11/9/18, 10:17:47 PM] Yi Kai: Especially English
[11/9/18, 10:17:54 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: why
[11/9/18, 10:17:57 PM] Yi Kai: It’s like CSC borderline A2
[11/9/18, 10:18:03 PM] Yi Kai: English borderline A2
[11/9/18, 10:18:14 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: lol
[11/9/18, 10:18:17 PM] Yi Kai: Chinese should be B4 as usual but because moderate become B3
[11/9/18, 10:18:33 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oh
[11/9/18, 10:18:46 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: what exemptions can u get
[11/9/18, 10:18:49 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: can u get physics
[11/9/18, 10:18:50 PM] Yi Kai: The rest is a bit more expected, but it’s already enough subjects to undo all the improvements on MSG
[11/9/18, 10:18:55 PM] Yi Kai: Depends on practical
[11/9/18, 10:19:02 PM] Yi Kai: Chem maybe, depend on Wui
[11/9/18, 10:19:05 PM] Yi Kai: Quiz*
[11/9/18, 10:19:10 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: haiz
[11/9/18, 10:19:11 PM] Yi Kai: Then there’s math
[11/9/18, 10:19:18 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: lol
[11/9/18, 10:19:37 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: sec 1 was so good
[11/9/18, 10:19:46 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: they let u skip lessons if u get exemption
[11/9/18, 10:19:58 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: sec 2 they made us stay for a bit more i think
[11/9/18, 10:20:02 PM] Yi Kai: Too many people game
[11/9/18, 10:20:06 PM] Yi Kai: So yah
[11/9/18, 10:20:15 PM] Yi Kai: Anyway I’m not sure if maumu will let me leave
[11/9/18, 10:20:25 PM] Yi Kai: Cause if I stay in class also damn awkward
[11/9/18, 10:20:39 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: mm
[11/9/18, 10:20:45 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i wanna leave cohen
[11/9/18, 10:20:48 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: pls
[11/9/18, 10:21:11 PM] Yi Kai: Got chance?
[11/9/18, 10:21:19 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i got 82.5 average
[11/9/18, 10:21:33 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: but if criteria is 85 then
[11/9/18, 10:21:39 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: nvm

[11/9/18, 10:22:04 PM] Yi Kai: I no chance though
[11/9/18, 10:22:09 PM] Yi Kai: One A1 one C6
[11/9/18, 10:22:22 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: is ok u have like 3 potential exemptions anyways
[11/9/18, 10:22:25 PM] Yi Kai: I can’t rush through compre without screwing up siah
[11/9/18, 10:22:36 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i cant do aq
[11/9/18, 10:22:37 PM] Yi Kai: Aiyah but I don’t care about math
[11/9/18, 10:22:41 PM] Yi Kai: Same
[11/9/18, 10:22:52 PM] Yi Kai: Then she make us rush to try out AQ
[11/9/18, 10:23:01 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: like i dun even know the format
[11/9/18, 10:23:08 PM] Yi Kai: When I say I want bring home to try and practice AQ she just rejects
[11/9/18, 10:23:10 PM] Yi Kai: Wow
[11/9/18, 10:23:17 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: lol i witnessed that
[11/9/18, 10:23:22 PM] Yi Kai: Just find the logical flow in the Writers arguments first
[11/9/18, 10:23:28 PM] Yi Kai: Then find fault
[11/9/18, 10:23:47 PM] Yi Kai: Then find damn general examples
[11/9/18, 10:24:02 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: lol
[11/9/18, 10:24:05 PM] Yi Kai: Like people with the name Bernard tend not to be straight
[11/9/18, 10:24:10 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oops
[11/9/18, 10:24:30 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: people with the name boston sleeps an average of 5 hours a day
[11/9/18, 10:24:47 PM] Yi Kai: I’m actually a good student by sleep
[11/9/18, 10:24:51 PM] Yi Kai: I don’t get how
[11/9/18, 10:24:59 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: huh
[11/9/18, 10:25:12 PM] Yi Kai: Well considering the sufficient sleep I’m not bad
[11/9/18, 10:25:24 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oh
[11/9/18, 10:25:30 PM] Yi Kai: I should go bathe and sleep
[11/9/18, 10:25:38 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: during slf ang said i was above average
[11/9/18, 10:25:43 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i guess times have changed
[11/9/18, 10:25:47 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: u bathe so late
[11/9/18, 10:25:48 PM] Yi Kai: Wow ok
[11/9/18, 10:25:53 PM] Yi Kai: For sleep?
[11/9/18, 10:25:56 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: yeah
[11/9/18, 10:25:59 PM] Yi Kai: I like to bathe right before I sleep
[11/9/18, 10:26:03 PM] Yi Kai: As close as possible
[11/9/18, 10:26:05 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oh
[11/9/18, 10:26:15 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ok then go bathe and sleep
[11/9/18, 10:26:18 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: good nightt
[11/9/18, 10:26:21 PM] Yi Kai: Ok bye
[11/9/18, 10:26:24 PM] Yi Kai: Go and sleep
[11/9/18, 10:26:27 PM] Yi Kai: Sleep by 11
[11/9/18, 10:26:28 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: no !
[11/9/18, 10:26:33 PM] Yi Kai: No I
[11/9/18, 10:26:35 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i need to do physics paper b
[11/9/18, 10:26:37 PM] Yi Kai: No u
[11/9/18, 10:26:40 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: yes u
[11/9/18, 10:26:45 PM] Yi Kai: I did paper 1 Liao
[11/9/18, 10:26:51 PM] Yi Kai: Just leave paper 2 for bio
[11/9/18, 10:27:06 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oh yes
[11/9/18, 10:27:08 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: thwres bio tmr
[11/9/18, 10:27:11 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ok bye
[12/9/18, 7:13:55 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: for physics we need to write the formula before substituting values into it right
[12/9/18, 7:15:00 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: and lets say you found value A which is not exact however u rounded off to 3 sf due to the sf rules, and the next question requires u to use A to calculate, what degree of accuracy is A in
[12/9/18, 8:02:48 PM] Yi Kai: No, but it’s always good to do that
[12/9/18, 8:03:09 PM] Yi Kai: Not sure, but I’ll use the rounded off value
[12/9/18, 8:05:10 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ok thanks
‎[12/9/18, 8:53:13 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ‎image omitted
[12/9/18, 8:53:34 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: isnt the light ray in medium 2 when it undergoes TIR
[12/9/18, 9:38:48 PM] Yi Kai: Think about when tir can occur
[12/9/18, 9:39:11 PM] Yi Kai: Generally we see it occur as it goes from glass or water to air
[12/9/18, 9:39:45 PM] Yi Kai: So basically it only occurs if light is going from a medium of higher refractive index to medium of lower refractive index
[12/9/18, 9:47:50 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: wait so
[12/9/18, 9:48:11 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: the tir occurs at the instant where the light ray passes from medium 1 into medium 2
[12/9/18, 9:48:18 PM] Yi Kai: Yes
[12/9/18, 9:48:23 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: not it passes into medium 2 then it goes through tir
[12/9/18, 9:48:24 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: omg
[12/9/18, 9:48:29 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: scam
[12/9/18, 9:48:39 PM] Yi Kai: When it enters a medium of lower optical density it will bend away from the normal
[12/9/18, 9:48:48 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: did u go for optoonal training today
[12/9/18, 9:48:55 PM] Yi Kai: But then if it will like bend away too much then it will end up reflecting
[12/9/18, 9:49:03 PM] Yi Kai: I had no cc kit so I don’t go
[12/9/18, 9:49:06 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oh
[12/9/18, 9:49:10 PM] Yi Kai: Tomorrow I don’t think I want to go
[12/9/18, 9:49:18 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oh
[13/9/18, 4:34:31 PM] Yi Kai: Erm what must we know for theory ah?
[13/9/18, 4:44:22 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: check the guidelines lor
[13/9/18, 4:44:26 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: theres quite  abit
[13/9/18, 11:17:23 PM] Yi Kai: Did you Mug?
[13/9/18, 11:17:34 PM] Yi Kai: I didn’t and I honestly want to Dao
[13/9/18, 11:17:51 PM] Yi Kai: Anyway for tent pitching need 6 people so both groups need to pitch tgt
[13/9/18, 11:19:26 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: yeah
[13/9/18, 11:19:30 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: im gonna try
[13/9/18, 11:19:41 PM] Yi Kai: Ok lol
[13/9/18, 11:19:50 PM] Yi Kai: Where to find the manuals ah?

[13/9/18, 11:20:44 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: same
[15/9/18, 3:35:41 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: why are the axises at which the sin and cos graph start on different

[15/9/18, 5:00:53 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oh
[15/9/18, 6:04:19 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: how do u describe the locus

[15/9/18, 6:06:22 PM] Yi Kai: Go and Desmos lorh
[15/9/18, 6:06:36 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: but what do the numbers on the x axis mean
[15/9/18, 6:06:43 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: on drsmos or geogebra
[15/9/18, 6:06:55 PM] Yi Kai: In terms of pi
[15/9/18, 6:07:13 PM] Yi Kai: Like when you use graphing software right?
[15/9/18, 6:07:22 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: yes
[15/9/18, 6:07:31 PM] Yi Kai: Yah it’s in terms of pi
[15/9/18, 6:07:37 PM] Yi Kai: And there are asymptotes
[15/9/18, 6:07:44 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ok thankss
[16/9/18, 1:33:42 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: how many types of motion graphs are there
[16/9/18, 1:33:53 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: is it velocity time, displacement time, acceleration time only
[16/9/18, 1:44:25 PM] Yi Kai: Should be
[16/9/18, 1:44:37 PM] Yi Kai: But there are also those scalars?
[16/9/18, 1:45:59 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: so distance and speed ah
[16/9/18, 2:06:42 PM] Yi Kai: Yah
[16/9/18, 2:06:55 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: is the area under a velocity time graph distance travelled or displacement
[16/9/18, 2:07:07 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: cus angsh slides write distance but i think its displacement
[16/9/18, 2:07:12 PM] Yi Kai: Displacement
[16/9/18, 2:07:16 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oo
[16/9/18, 2:07:20 PM] Yi Kai: Why you asking these though
[16/9/18, 2:07:27 PM] Yi Kai: Are you like revising physics?
[16/9/18, 2:07:35 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: maybe shes assuming that the velocity is the object travelling in a striaght line
[16/9/18, 2:07:38 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: yeah
[16/9/18, 2:07:45 PM] Yi Kai: Yah maybe
[16/9/18, 2:07:56 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ok thanks
[16/9/18, 2:08:01 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i havent done chem set b though
[16/9/18, 2:08:10 PM] Yi Kai: I did paper 1 yesterday
[16/9/18, 2:08:15 PM] Yi Kai: I going to do paper 2
[16/9/18, 2:08:15 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oh
[16/9/18, 2:08:24 PM] Yi Kai: Just realised there’s chem lesson tomorrow
[16/9/18, 2:08:29 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: same
[16/9/18, 2:24:03 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: since the area under graph of a velocity time graph is displacement, so lets say the graph is like this
‎[16/9/18, 2:24:32 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ‎image omitted
[16/9/18, 2:24:53 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: so the displacement is 1/2(10-0)(5-0) right
[16/9/18, 2:25:08 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: which is 1/2 (u-v)t
[16/9/18, 2:25:29 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: but the equation of motion is s = 1/2 (u+v)t
[16/9/18, 2:25:30 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: why
[16/9/18, 2:52:15 PM] Yi Kai: t us 5-0, u is 10, v is 0
[16/9/18, 2:52:57 PM] Yi Kai: Because area under a trapezium is half times first length times second length times height. In this case the 2 lengths are u and v, while the height is t
[16/9/18, 2:54:15 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: but its a triangle not trapezium
[16/9/18, 2:54:38 PM] Yi Kai: You can think of it as a trapezium with one of the sides having length 0
[16/9/18, 2:55:36 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oh
[16/9/18, 2:55:42 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: thanks
[16/9/18, 2:55:44 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: uvovjuv0
[16/9/18, 2:56:44 PM] Yi Kai: ?
[16/9/18, 2:56:53 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: nth
[16/9/18, 2:57:00 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i want to give up
[16/9/18, 3:00:46 PM] Yi Kai: My Father is damn retarded one siah
[16/9/18, 3:01:14 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: why
[16/9/18, 3:01:23 PM] Yi Kai: My com battery got issue, then go and fix and now it keeps hanging
[16/9/18, 3:01:33 PM] Yi Kai: Then when it’s ok he keeps randomly resetting stuff
[16/9/18, 3:01:41 PM] Yi Kai: And it hangs more
[16/9/18, 3:01:46 PM] Yi Kai: Then he blames adobe
[16/9/18, 3:01:53 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: why adobe though
[16/9/18, 3:02:52 PM] Yi Kai: Because he says that adobe used to have compatibility issues
[16/9/18, 3:03:09 PM] Yi Kai: And it’s quite stupid when he insists on anything
[16/9/18, 3:03:24 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: generation gap
[16/9/18, 3:03:31 PM] Yi Kai: Lol
[16/9/18, 3:03:43 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: haiz
[16/9/18, 3:03:49 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i need to go for piano now
[16/9/18, 3:03:55 PM] Yi Kai: Wow ok
[16/9/18, 3:03:58 PM] Yi Kai: Never knew
[16/9/18, 3:04:02 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: its also retarded
[16/9/18, 3:04:10 PM] Yi Kai: Why leh?
[16/9/18, 3:04:25 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: like i need to stop work for this
[16/9/18, 3:04:26 PM] Yi Kai: But then not many people still do piano at this age though
[16/9/18, 3:04:35 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: really
[16/9/18, 3:04:43 PM] Yi Kai: Aiyah it’s better for you to have a reason to slack
[16/9/18, 3:04:47 PM] Yi Kai: I don’t know though
[16/9/18, 3:04:57 PM] Yi Kai: I don’t really hear about it anymore
[16/9/18, 3:05:05 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i mean like my parents dont 管 whether im slacking or not
[16/9/18, 3:05:11 PM] Yi Kai: Lol ok
[16/9/18, 3:05:13 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oh
[16/9/18, 3:05:38 PM] Yi Kai: But it allocates a time for you to slack. To me that helps me slack less lah
[16/9/18, 3:05:55 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: lol it makes me slack more
[16/9/18, 3:06:00 PM] Yi Kai: Wow ok
[16/9/18, 3:06:06 PM] Yi Kai: Does it give homework?
[16/9/18, 3:06:06 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: cus like i dont regard this as slacking
[16/9/18, 3:06:11 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: nope
[16/9/18, 3:06:12 PM] Yi Kai: Wow
[16/9/18, 3:06:25 PM] Yi Kai: Then still ok lah, not like tuition
[16/9/18, 3:06:38 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: but tuition lets u revise
[16/9/18, 3:06:45 PM] Yi Kai: Not really
[16/9/18, 3:06:53 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: idk la
[16/9/18, 3:06:56 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: why
[16/9/18, 3:07:21 PM] Yi Kai: My Chinese one is the teacher just have many students at random, then take turns to attend to each person and give you something like corrections to do
[16/9/18, 3:07:32 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: what
[16/9/18, 3:07:34 PM] Yi Kai: So I always end up being very bored
[16/9/18, 3:07:40 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: lol
[16/9/18, 3:07:47 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: change ur teacher
[16/9/18, 3:07:48 PM] Yi Kai: That’s for my Chinese, that’s why it’s so cheap
[16/9/18, 3:07:52 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oh
[16/9/18, 3:07:59 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: how much
[16/9/18, 3:08:00 PM] Yi Kai: About 100 per 4 lessons
[16/9/18, 3:08:11 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: how long
[16/9/18, 3:08:12 PM] Yi Kai: English is like much better
[16/9/18, 3:08:32 PM] Yi Kai: 2 hour for each, but I waste about 30 minutes each time
[16/9/18, 3:08:39 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: hmm
[16/9/18, 3:08:51 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: he earns 12.5 dollars every hour from every student
[16/9/18, 3:08:59 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: what a profitable business
[16/9/18, 3:08:59 PM] Yi Kai: She*
[16/9/18, 3:09:08 PM] Yi Kai: And there’s like 5 students all the time
[16/9/18, 3:09:13 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: woah
[16/9/18, 3:09:22 PM] Yi Kai: So it’s kind of illegal, considering that it’s at her home
[16/9/18, 3:09:33 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i wanna also be a tuition teavher
[16/9/18, 3:09:35 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oops

[18/9/18, 2:21:30 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: wanna waste the 1.5h bio lesson tmr on atomas again
[18/9/18, 2:23:15 PM] Yi Kai: No
[18/9/18, 2:23:32 PM] Yi Kai: Not just wasting time, also wasting battery
[18/9/18, 2:23:52 PM] Yi Kai: Can send me the math textbook questions when you’re free today? Thanks

[18/9/18, 6:46:43 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: cus its like every 180 degrees
[18/9/18, 7:37:05 PM] Yi Kai: E1 or what?
[18/9/18, 7:37:17 PM] Yi Kai: Take it as every 360 degrees
[18/9/18, 7:37:44 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: huh
[18/9/18, 7:37:50 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: yeah
[18/9/18, 7:38:17 PM] Yi Kai: The cycle repeats every 360 degrees what...
‎[18/9/18, 7:38:35 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ‎image omitted
[18/9/18, 7:38:36 PM] Yi Kai: For tan it’s 180 but the other 2 is 360 so might as well say 360
[18/9/18, 7:38:49 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: but its seperate
[18/9/18, 7:38:54 PM] Yi Kai: Just the x
[18/9/18, 7:39:10 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: so can just say 180 for sin and cos and 360 for tan right
[18/9/18, 7:39:16 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: how do u even define it
[18/9/18, 7:39:46 PM] Yi Kai: No...
[18/9/18, 7:39:55 PM] Yi Kai: It’s undefined when there’s zero division
[18/9/18, 7:40:08 PM] Yi Kai: So just put values where sin and cos are 0.
[18/9/18, 7:40:26 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: but its infinite
[18/9/18, 7:40:36 PM] Yi Kai: For tan just put the asymptotes when tan is undefined, and put values where tan is 0
[18/9/18, 7:40:38 PM] Yi Kai: No
[18/9/18, 7:40:51 PM] Yi Kai: Based on graph of sin x it’s not infinite
[18/9/18, 7:41:08 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oh golly
[18/9/18, 7:41:30 PM] Yi Kai: It only cuts the axis at some parts
[18/9/18, 7:41:52 PM] Yi Kai: This one just split case do, cause I didn’t know how
[18/9/18, 7:42:01 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: but there are infinite solutions of sin x = 0
[18/9/18, 7:42:18 PM] Yi Kai: Just put within 360
[18/9/18, 7:42:23 PM] Yi Kai: Cause that’s one full round
[18/9/18, 7:42:55 PM] Yi Kai: Or you write (mod 360) there
[18/9/18, 7:42:56 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: thats so scam
[18/9/18, 7:43:00 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oh ya
[18/9/18, 7:43:28 PM] Yi Kai: Why is Fu Xiang not sending it yet...
[18/9/18, 7:43:45 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: lol let me ask him
[18/9/18, 7:44:02 PM] Yi Kai: Should be done soon lah
[18/9/18, 7:46:08 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: loke still approving
[18/9/18, 7:54:51 PM] Yi Kai: Wow...
[18/9/18, 7:55:01 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: Hi Lai Fun, can you please hurry up and approve the recent CAPE results? It is very unbecoming of you as a DSP to delay this process; future AnA departments will merely follow in your footsteps and the overall standard of HCINPCC will drop. Should you not submit the approved CAPE results by 18 September, 2359h, please hand me your letter of resignation from your designation. Thanks Lai Fun.

Sent from my Hua Wei Mate 10 Pro
[18/9/18, 7:55:05 PM] Yi Kai: How does one do higher paper for chem...
[18/9/18, 7:55:16 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: no idea i cant even do 1 question
[18/9/18, 7:55:22 PM] Yi Kai: Same
[18/9/18, 7:55:39 PM] Yi Kai: I don’t understand how A2 works
[18/9/18, 7:55:45 PM] Yi Kai: Tancw email?
[18/9/18, 7:55:57 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: no
[18/9/18, 7:55:59 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i wrote it
[18/9/18, 7:56:00 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ahaha
[18/9/18, 7:56:06 PM] Yi Kai: Don’t bs
[18/9/18, 7:56:15 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: fun
[18/9/18, 7:56:17 PM] Yi Kai: You won’t even know she promoted to DSP
[18/9/18, 7:56:22 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: huh
[18/9/18, 7:56:28 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: wdym
[18/9/18, 7:56:35 PM] Yi Kai: Why would you know
[18/9/18, 7:56:40 PM] Yi Kai: It’s like quite recent
[18/9/18, 7:56:49 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: zhouxuan sent in the ss chay
[18/9/18, 7:56:51 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: chat
[18/9/18, 7:56:59 PM] Yi Kai: And I updated it on unit website before my com spoiled again luckily
[18/9/18, 7:57:02 PM] Yi Kai: Oh yah
[18/9/18, 7:57:07 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: lol
[18/9/18, 7:57:08 PM] Yi Kai: So it’s fake lah
[18/9/18, 7:57:12 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ya
[18/9/18, 7:57:18 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: why would maumu send that
[18/9/18, 7:57:26 PM] Yi Kai: He’s maumu
[18/9/18, 7:57:34 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: btw last page of math worksheet need draw graph?
[18/9/18, 7:57:48 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: hand in ur letter of resignation from designation
[18/9/18, 7:58:35 PM] Yi Kai: No
[18/9/18, 7:58:42 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: bless
‎[18/9/18, 9:43:06 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ‎image omitted
[18/9/18, 9:43:12 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: the answer only shows 161.6
[18/9/18, 9:44:31 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: is it cause sin x needs to be positive
[18/9/18, 9:44:37 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: but why
[18/9/18, 9:52:59 PM] Yi Kai: Why so fast...
[18/9/18, 9:53:11 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: fast meh
[18/9/18, 9:53:19 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i havent done states of matter and higher chrm
[18/9/18, 9:54:36 PM] Yi Kai: The denominator cannot be 0
[18/9/18, 9:55:06 PM] Yi Kai: If you take the exact form of 198.4, you get 0 for the denominator in the fraction
[18/9/18, 9:55:33 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: wat the
[18/9/18, 9:55:49 PM] Yi Kai: It’s not hard what...
[18/9/18, 9:55:55 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: do u check and reject or are u supposed to do something beforehand then u reject
[18/9/18, 9:56:18 PM] Yi Kai: Just say at the start that denominator cannot be 0, then can solve the inequality
[18/9/18, 9:56:33 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: inequality?
[18/9/18, 9:56:47 PM] Yi Kai: I don’t know what it’s called
[18/9/18, 9:56:50 PM] Yi Kai: Just simplify it
[18/9/18, 9:56:57 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: hiw
[18/9/18, 9:56:58 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: how
[18/9/18, 9:57:46 PM] Yi Kai: sin x cannot be 1/root(10)
[18/9/18, 9:57:59 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ohh
[18/9/18, 9:58:03 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ok thanks
[18/9/18, 9:58:13 PM] Yi Kai: Then relate it to cos x (I don’t know how)
[18/9/18, 9:58:27 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: dont need what
[18/9/18, 9:58:44 PM] Yi Kai: Ok fine anything
[18/9/18, 9:58:53 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ok ty
[18/9/18, 9:59:11 PM] Yi Kai: Because I’m at 1.1
[18/9/18, 9:59:29 PM] Yi Kai: I had 30 minutes and I wasn’t going to sleep so I just do parts of math assignment
[18/9/18, 9:59:31 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: did u finish higher chem alr
[18/9/18, 9:59:35 PM] Yi Kai: Yes
[18/9/18, 9:59:37 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oh
[18/9/18, 9:59:39 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: wth
[18/9/18, 9:59:41 PM] Yi Kai: States of matter do yesterday
[18/9/18, 9:59:47 PM] Yi Kai: Damn cancer though
[18/9/18, 9:59:49 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: die me
[18/9/18, 9:59:52 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i agree
[18/9/18, 10:00:50 PM] Yi Kai: Just skip the undoable stuff
[18/9/18, 10:01:00 PM] Yi Kai: Not meant to get 75% easily anyway
[18/9/18, 10:01:18 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: true
[18/9/18, 10:01:26 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i dont think i can even get a pass
[18/9/18, 10:01:31 PM] Yi Kai: Can lah
[18/9/18, 10:01:41 PM] Yi Kai: Section B a bit easier if you can QA
[18/9/18, 10:02:12 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i cant
[18/9/18, 10:02:21 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: lol nvm i leave that for later
[18/9/18, 10:02:32 PM] Yi Kai: B2 is the easiest in section B
[18/9/18, 10:02:39 PM] Yi Kai: I was stupid to want to skip that one
[18/9/18, 10:02:49 PM] Yi Kai: Cause you can choose not to do one of the 3
[18/9/18, 10:02:59 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oh
[18/9/18, 10:03:07 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ok thanks
[18/9/18, 10:10:42 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: wait if u do this then the next part is weird also
[18/9/18, 10:10:50 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: cause the 2nd part accepts the 198.4
[18/9/18, 10:11:08 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: but the only thing that changes is sqrt 10 to 10
[18/9/18, 10:11:46 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: if u try to find x its like -18.4 which is weird and idk how it shows anything
[18/9/18, 10:12:22 PM] Yi Kai: Sorry it’s -1/root 10 firstly
[18/9/18, 10:12:34 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: yeah its still the same
[18/9/18, 10:12:45 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: u get sin x cannot be -1/10
[18/9/18, 10:13:09 PM] Yi Kai: Tbh what’s the difference between finding the roots and solving...
[18/9/18, 10:13:21 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: the roots thing u can accept 198.4
[18/9/18, 10:13:33 PM] Yi Kai: Why?
[18/9/18, 10:13:43 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i also dk
[18/9/18, 10:13:49 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i checked the answers
[18/9/18, 10:13:53 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ahh
[18/9/18, 10:14:05 PM] Yi Kai: I think it’s because it’s roots
[18/9/18, 10:14:49 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oh
[18/9/18, 10:14:54 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oh my
[18/9/18, 10:15:08 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ok i get it now
[18/9/18, 10:15:17 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ibthink
[18/9/18, 10:17:02 PM] Yi Kai: Kao
[18/9/18, 10:17:14 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: nvm i dont
[18/9/18, 10:17:21 PM] Yi Kai: The website I go for answers only has up to question 12 in 11.2
[18/9/18, 10:17:29 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: lol
[18/9/18, 10:18:24 PM] Yi Kai: But the question says state
[18/9/18, 10:18:29 PM] Yi Kai: So I think just give answer?
[18/9/18, 10:19:03 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ok then
[18/9/18, 10:19:09 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: but whats rhe correct conclusion
[18/9/18, 10:19:16 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: for this
[18/9/18, 10:26:51 PM] Yi Kai: Rejected because sin x cannot be wtv
[18/9/18, 10:27:05 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: but
[18/9/18, 10:27:09 PM] Yi Kai: But to make maumu happy at the front should already state that such a solution is rejected
[18/9/18, 10:27:10 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: x is like -18.4
[18/9/18, 10:27:28 PM] Yi Kai: So that he’s convinced you didn’t just sub to original
[18/9/18, 10:27:31 PM] Yi Kai: Nani?
[18/9/18, 10:27:53 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ya

[18/9/18, 10:28:45 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oh golly
[18/9/18, 10:28:54 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i should just sub into the equation
[18/9/18, 10:28:57 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: cus it doesnt make sense for me
[18/9/18, 10:32:00 PM] Yi Kai: The first line?
[18/9/18, 10:32:07 PM] Yi Kai: I should stop work soon
[18/9/18, 10:32:37 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: if u find x from sin x = -1/sqrt 10
[18/9/18, 10:32:42 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: its -18.4
[18/9/18, 10:36:57 PM] Yi Kai: There can be multiple solutions?
[18/9/18, 10:37:18 PM] Yi Kai: It doesn’t have to be 4th quadrant, it can also be in 3rd quadrant
[18/9/18, 10:37:31 PM] Yi Kai: Plus the 18.4 is not exact value, not very good to use
[18/9/18, 10:46:07 PM] Yi Kai: Good meme SGT haven’t send yet

[19/9/18, 9:34:10 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: u get the answer if u remove both of the 1000
[19/9/18, 9:49:12 PM] Yi Kai: 'Cause they will cancel out? The one on density is just times 1000, same for density
[19/9/18, 9:49:48 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i think my math fail
[19/9/18, 9:50:04 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oh ok i get it

[19/9/18, 9:51:56 PM] Yi Kai: You know the question asking you the relationship between the 2 roots alpha and betta?
[19/9/18, 9:52:02 PM] Yi Kai: What's the textbook answer?
[19/9/18, 9:52:21 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: which question
[19/9/18, 9:52:51 PM] Yi Kai: 11.3, q21 part ii
[19/9/18, 9:53:14 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: beta = 2pi - alpha
[19/9/18, 9:53:14 PM] Yi Kai: The one where I took average
[19/9/18, 9:53:22 PM] Yi Kai: Wait that's the actual answer?
[19/9/18, 9:53:28 PM] Yi Kai: So i'm actually right...
[19/9/18, 9:53:28 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: yeah

[19/9/18, 9:55:31 PM] Yi Kai: why not? I got the same thing
[19/9/18, 9:55:39 PM] Yi Kai: Just that mine has plus minus, not sure if supposed to have

[19/9/18, 9:56:52 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i dont know how to simplify it
[19/9/18, 9:57:40 PM] Yi Kai: Bruh
[19/9/18, 9:57:49 PM] Yi Kai: You draw the triangle for the inside value first
[19/9/18, 9:58:04 PM] Yi Kai: Then you use the triangle lengths to find the ratios
[19/9/18, 9:59:23 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: huh
[19/9/18, 10:00:13 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: wait so the inside and outside has the same triabfle
[19/9/18, 10:00:20 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oo
[19/9/18, 10:02:02 PM] Yi Kai: Yes...
[19/9/18, 10:02:05 PM] Yi Kai: Read the hint
[19/9/18, 10:04:01 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: how do u know
[19/9/18, 10:04:07 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: if the minus is -1 or -5
[19/9/18, 10:08:41 PM] Yi Kai: Using the quadrants?
[19/9/18, 10:08:56 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: wont there be 2 values of sin
[20/9/18, 6:05:49 AM] Yi Kai: That’s my current issue
[20/9/18, 6:13:53 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oh
[21/9/18, 11:30:28 PM] Yi Kai: So close yet so far to having one more leap point
[21/9/18, 11:30:34 PM] Yi Kai: Sigh... corporal

[22/9/18, 11:40:31 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i very lazy sia
[22/9/18, 11:40:37 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: theres like 2 more chem higher paperw
[22/9/18, 11:40:39 AM] Yi Kai: I’m exempted from the subjects but not the higher paper
[22/9/18, 11:40:43 AM] Yi Kai: Just do one
[22/9/18, 11:40:57 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: hmm
[22/9/18, 11:41:07 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: and how to mug for el and cl

[22/9/18, 11:41:39 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ironically i screwed up more for math and sciences than languages
[22/9/18, 11:41:49 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: this is sad
[22/9/18, 11:42:02 AM] Yi Kai: Are those your stronger subjects?

[22/9/18, 11:16:19 PM] Yi Kai: Lol I hope so
[22/9/18, 11:16:42 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: how do u calculate force on inclined plane
[22/9/18, 11:16:53 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: like do u have to multiply by cos theta or something
[23/9/18, 12:47:40 AM] Yi Kai: Wdym?
[23/9/18, 12:47:46 AM] Yi Kai: The area or what?
[23/9/18, 12:47:58 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: cus like
[23/9/18, 12:48:12 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: the friction decreases as the angle of inclination increases
[23/9/18, 12:48:15 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: and why r u awake
[23/9/18, 12:48:53 AM] Yi Kai: Cause I was out

[23/9/18, 1:01:21 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oh
[23/9/18, 1:01:21 AM] Yi Kai: But I tend to get hungry especially this year, maybe cause my parents shifted dieting habits
[23/9/18, 1:01:24 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i eat at 8
[23/9/18, 1:01:28 AM] Yi Kai: No wonder

[24/9/18, 10:31:21 PM] Yi Kai: Yes they do
[24/9/18, 10:31:21 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: like u need find the volume of seawater on esrth first right
[24/9/18, 10:31:29 PM] Yi Kai: Estimate surface area of the sea
[24/9/18, 10:31:39 PM] Yi Kai: Estimate wrong at most -1, then error carry forward
[24/9/18, 10:31:53 PM] Yi Kai: Supposed to be like 10^16 m^2 around there
[24/9/18, 10:32:01 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: got working one?
[25/9/18, 6:07:57 AM] Yi Kai: Estimate no need working one though
[25/9/18, 6:08:16 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: that's so scam
[25/9/18, 6:08:24 AM] Yi Kai: Unless you’re like Bernard who estimates the circumference of the earth first then use formula to find surface area
[25/9/18, 6:08:32 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oh lol

[28/9/18, 8:25:49 PM] Yi Kai: I’m out now can I answer your question tomorrow
[28/9/18, 8:26:17 PM] Yi Kai: Cause my house was under renovation and my family intends to major clean up the house
[28/9/18, 8:26:55 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oh lol
[28/9/18, 8:26:57 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ok sure
[30/9/18, 5:58:33 PM] Yi Kai: If you still don't know, the other time you asked me what's M in set D paper 2. Now I found out that it's just mol dm-3
[30/9/18, 5:58:48 PM] Yi Kai: Molar concentration. ... In chemistry, the most commonly used unit for molarity is the number of moles per litre, having the unit symbol mol/L. A solution with a concentration of 1 mol/L is said to be 1 molar, commonly designated as 1 M.

[30/9/18, 5:59:15 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: what abt this
[30/9/18, 6:00:22 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: this is for the numerator
[30/9/18, 6:02:54 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oh wait the -2 just disappeared, but even if i accounted for that the answer would be different
[30/9/18, 6:03:51 PM] Yi Kai: 5th line supposed to be - 1/(h^2-2)
[30/9/18, 6:04:33 PM] Yi Kai: And you might want to note that the third step both sides has to be positive, so h^2 is definitely between 1 and 2(I think, based on right side)
[30/9/18, 6:05:21 PM] Yi Kai: think about that one, 'cause if you bring the minus sign into the fraction...
[30/9/18, 6:05:09 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: why
[30/9/18, 6:05:55 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: but then it would mean that at the 2nd part u squareroot a negative expression
[30/9/18, 6:06:39 PM] Yi Kai: h^2-2 can be negative?
[30/9/18, 6:06:50 PM] Yi Kai: So that this will increase the value?
[30/9/18, 6:07:06 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: golly
[30/9/18, 6:07:13 PM] Yi Kai: And if this is true then the last step shouldn't be +-, just positive
[30/9/18, 6:07:26 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: wth
[30/9/18, 6:07:38 PM] Yi Kai: Wait maybe the +2 will change things I don't know
[30/9/18, 6:08:26 PM] Yi Kai: It's either both h^2 -1 and 2-h^2 are positive or both are negative, but if the first one is negative then the second one is positive
[30/9/18, 6:08:42 PM] Yi Kai: So has to be both positive, and in that case h^2 is between 1 and 2

[30/9/18, 6:11:10 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: wrong
[30/9/18, 6:11:17 PM] Yi Kai: What's supposed to be the answer?
[30/9/18, 6:11:34 PM] Yi Kai: Can simplify to +-gy though

[30/9/18, 6:13:36 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: idk why im so dumb go do such a complicated way
[30/9/18, 6:14:42 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: thanks
[4/10/18, 4:21:07 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: are u gonna mug ss with the textbook?
[4/10/18, 4:30:30 PM] Yi Kai: Probably
[4/10/18, 4:30:59 PM] Yi Kai: I think I'll practise CSC first, like the first one she gave us 'cause she gave us the points so I'll practice writing it
[4/10/18, 5:05:12 PM] Yi Kai: Wow I've been slacking for like 2 hours
[4/10/18, 5:05:16 PM] Yi Kai: I feel so bad now
[4/10/18, 6:49:47 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: lol
[4/10/18, 6:50:05 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: are the questions  the same as usual
[4/10/18, 7:13:59 PM] Yi Kai: Yah
[4/10/18, 7:14:52 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: then arent we given an extra 15 mins than usual
[4/10/18, 7:16:02 PM] Yi Kai: Yes, I also find it weird
[4/10/18, 7:27:23 PM] Yi Kai: Should I study Xiang Yang or chun en notes
[4/10/18, 7:30:12 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ss?
[4/10/18, 8:57:39 PM] Yi Kai: Yah
[4/10/18, 8:58:08 PM] Yi Kai: Other than SS I'm fine with my other subjects ('cause I didn't really intend on mugging Chinese and English)
[4/10/18, 8:58:39 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: chinese and english was ok though
[4/10/18, 8:58:43 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: why not both
[4/10/18, 8:58:53 PM] Yi Kai: I lazy
[4/10/18, 8:59:07 PM] Yi Kai: I mean like Chun En is more zai, but Xiang Yang is more hardcore
[4/10/18, 8:59:59 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i dont even know if i should mug their notes
[4/10/18, 9:00:10 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: theres so much math stuff i alr forgor
[4/10/18, 9:00:23 PM] Yi Kai: Like what?
[4/10/18, 9:00:44 PM] Yi Kai: 'Cause I don't really know what is math mugging
[4/10/18, 9:00:52 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: everything
[4/10/18, 9:00:54 PM] Yi Kai: Plus math is last day, have more time
[4/10/18, 9:00:58 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i cant remember anything
[4/10/18, 9:01:01 PM] Yi Kai: Tell me about functions
[4/10/18, 9:01:01 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: true
[4/10/18, 9:01:07 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i cant
[4/10/18, 9:01:08 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ahaha
[4/10/18, 9:01:08 PM] Yi Kai: I don't believe that
[4/10/18, 9:01:20 PM] Yi Kai: f(x)=x^2+x is the rule
[4/10/18, 9:01:25 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i cant even do the
[4/10/18, 9:01:33 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: revision worksheet on algebraic manipulation
[4/10/18, 9:01:35 PM] Yi Kai: 0<x<20 is the domain
[4/10/18, 9:01:45 PM] Yi Kai: That one is hard, I understand if you can't do it
[4/10/18, 9:01:46 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: huh
[4/10/18, 9:01:52 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: why is it so hard
[4/10/18, 9:01:57 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: makes me scared for eoy
[4/10/18, 9:01:59 PM] Yi Kai: Like an example domain
[4/10/18, 9:02:13 PM] Yi Kai: To practice your skills
[4/10/18, 9:02:18 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oh
[4/10/18, 9:02:21 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: hmmm
[4/10/18, 9:02:22 PM] Yi Kai: It's not the type meant to help you remember your stuff
[4/10/18, 9:02:46 PM] Yi Kai: If you want practices to check if you remember stuff then use the textbook questions - they're actually helpful
[4/10/18, 9:02:58 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: should i do the revision paper or the thick worksheets though
[4/10/18, 9:03:01 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i mean
[4/10/18, 9:03:07 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: revision worksheets or the eoy papers
[4/10/18, 9:03:13 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i lazy
[4/10/18, 9:03:21 PM] Yi Kai: I would think you should try eoy papers
[4/10/18, 9:03:26 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i think checking the math file is easier
[4/10/18, 9:03:29 PM] Yi Kai: If no time then just randomly try some questions
[4/10/18, 9:03:41 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ok thanks for the great advice
[4/10/18, 9:03:41 PM] Yi Kai: Ok...

But you won't remember anything
[4/10/18, 9:03:51 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i has like
[4/10/18, 9:04:10 PM] Yi Kai: Like math to me is like 10% memory and 90% understanding. Then chem is like the other way round
[4/10/18, 9:04:13 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: 4 days to mug for math chem phy
[4/10/18, 9:04:21 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oops
[4/10/18, 9:04:24 PM] Yi Kai: Physics on wednesday?
[4/10/18, 9:04:31 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: csc is 100% copying
[4/10/18, 9:04:34 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i think so
[4/10/18, 9:04:37 PM] Yi Kai: Lol sem
[4/10/18, 9:04:44 PM] Yi Kai: Ok
[4/10/18, 9:05:02 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: tmr a bit scam
[4/10/18, 9:05:11 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: go to school for 1.25 hour of exam
[4/10/18, 9:05:18 PM] Yi Kai: Lol true
[4/10/18, 9:05:26 PM] Yi Kai: I think I'll mug Xiang Yang notes for SS
[4/10/18, 9:05:31 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: hmm ok
[4/10/18, 9:05:37 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: its only for that 12 marks
[4/10/18, 9:05:38 PM] Yi Kai: 'Cause Chun En's one is just the study guide, it has no content
[4/10/18, 9:05:39 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: aa
[4/10/18, 9:05:55 PM] Yi Kai: True, more impt to remember the sbq formats and practice a bit
[4/10/18, 9:05:57 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: what is social studies out of?
[4/10/18, 9:06:02 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: mm
[4/10/18, 9:06:22 PM] Yi Kai: I don't know tbh
[4/10/18, 9:07:59 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i think 45
[4/10/18, 9:08:02 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: wait
[4/10/18, 9:08:06 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: or 50
[4/10/18, 9:08:21 PM] Yi Kai: 55

[4/10/18, 9:08:28 PM] Yi Kai: From iEMB
[4/10/18, 9:08:46 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: thanks
[4/10/18, 9:08:47 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: aaa
[4/10/18, 9:09:44 PM] Yi Kai: What you doing now lol
[4/10/18, 9:14:26 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: math
[4/10/18, 10:39:42 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: when do u have to mod a value
[4/10/18, 10:39:59 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: or mod an unknown
[5/10/18, 6:15:03 AM] Yi Kai: Like absolute or what? Like negative change to positive?
[5/10/18, 6:15:13 AM] Yi Kai: Cause there’s multiple definition of mod
[5/10/18, 6:16:19 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: yeah
[5/10/18, 6:16:48 AM] Yi Kai: Usually don’t need to use
[5/10/18, 6:16:54 AM] Yi Kai: Only in basic angle?
[5/10/18, 6:17:20 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: there was some paat worksheet that maumu gave
[5/10/18, 6:17:34 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: then it wrote sqrt (a^10) = mod a^5
[5/10/18, 6:37:50 AM] Yi Kai: Just like that?
[5/10/18, 6:38:52 AM] Yi Kai: Actually it’s doable though. a^10 = (a^5)^2 so  |a^5|=sqrt (a^10)
[5/10/18, 6:39:14 AM] Yi Kai: You can square both sides, and realise that a is one or zero
[5/10/18, 6:48:07 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oh i get it
[5/10/18, 6:48:23 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: so if the power is odd then it doesnt apply?
[5/10/18, 6:48:57 AM] Yi Kai: ?
[5/10/18, 6:49:07 AM] Yi Kai: The mod? If it’s even then the mod doesn’t matter
[5/10/18, 6:49:23 AM] Yi Kai: But since it’s odd the polarity of a is the polarity of a^5
[5/10/18, 6:49:51 AM] Yi Kai: Now thinking about it I think maybe need to +- on a
[5/10/18, 6:51:32 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: wait
[5/10/18, 6:51:38 AM] Yi Kai: Think of it as sqrt x^2 = |x|
[5/10/18, 6:52:03 AM] Yi Kai: Then once you get x you power 0.2, so that a^5 becomes a
[5/10/18, 6:52:17 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: why cant x be negative though
[5/10/18, 6:52:22 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oh wait
[5/10/18, 6:52:23 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: nvm
[5/10/18, 6:52:39 AM] Yi Kai: What did the question ask though
[5/10/18, 6:52:46 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: idk
[5/10/18, 6:52:48 AM] Yi Kai: Cause I think every value of a fits
[5/10/18, 6:52:52 AM] Yi Kai: ...
[5/10/18, 6:52:52 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i just saw that equation
[5/10/18, 6:53:06 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: what
[5/10/18, 6:53:11 AM] Yi Kai: Ok
[5/10/18, 6:53:21 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: a cant be negative
[5/10/18, 6:53:29 AM] Yi Kai: Not true
[5/10/18, 6:53:34 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: cus sqrts give u positives
[5/10/18, 6:53:42 AM] Yi Kai: If a is negative than right side is still positive
[5/10/18, 6:53:54 AM] Yi Kai: Left side has an even exponent so it’ll be positive
[5/10/18, 6:54:03 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oh no
[5/10/18, 6:54:11 AM] Yi Kai: Maybe question is asking you to prove it
[5/10/18, 6:55:15 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: photomath gives just positive x as answer
[5/10/18, 6:55:21 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: to sqrt x^2
[5/10/18, 6:55:35 AM] Yi Kai: Like wdym
[5/10/18, 6:55:43 AM] Yi Kai: This equation?
[5/10/18, 6:55:49 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: even though the x can be negative
[5/10/18, 6:56:04 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: it only produces a positive value
[5/10/18, 6:56:16 AM] Yi Kai: What equation you give?
[5/10/18, 6:56:19 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: so if x is negative u need to mod it
[5/10/18, 6:56:22 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: yeah
[5/10/18, 6:56:53 AM] Yi Kai: What’s that value?
[5/10/18, 6:57:06 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: x
[5/10/18, 6:57:06 AM] Yi Kai: The right hand side has mod though
[5/10/18, 6:57:22 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: cus the polarity on both sides has to match
[5/10/18, 6:57:43 AM] Yi Kai: But then when there’s mod it’ll always be positive
[5/10/18, 6:57:51 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: if u dont mod then sqrt x^2 can have a negative x, but since it produces positive value its wrong
[5/10/18, 6:58:14 AM] Yi Kai: How can sqrt x^2 be negative...
[5/10/18, 6:58:23 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: as in the x itself
[5/10/18, 6:58:25 AM] Yi Kai: Like if you don’t simplify it
[5/10/18, 6:58:29 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: not the whole expression
[5/10/18, 6:58:58 AM] Yi Kai: Yes it’ll produce positive value, which will be mod x
[5/10/18, 6:59:18 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: but you cant consider odd power right
[5/10/18, 6:59:24 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: sqrt x^3
[5/10/18, 6:59:34 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: this only works when its positive
[5/10/18, 6:59:40 AM] Yi Kai: Yes
[5/10/18, 6:59:50 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: so modding doesnt help ah
[5/10/18, 7:09:17 AM] Yi Kai: It’ll be useless
[5/10/18, 7:12:18 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: then what happened to the plusminus ure supposed to put when sqrting
[5/10/18, 7:28:26 AM] Yi Kai: sqrt 9 is 3 remember?
[5/10/18, 7:28:32 AM] Yi Kai: It’s not +-3
[5/10/18, 7:28:36 AM] Yi Kai: Same thing here

[6/10/18, 4:43:32 PM] Yi Kai: Is 8 pages in point form a lot?
[6/10/18, 4:43:38 PM] Yi Kai: I just mug Xiang Yang's notes

[6/10/18, 4:43:51 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oh
[6/10/18, 4:43:55 PM] Yi Kai: Then for SBQ just remember the acronyms
[6/10/18, 4:44:05 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: wat acronyms
[6/10/18, 4:44:13 PM] Yi Kai: Basically I would suggest you mug a bit today and mug a bit tomorrow for SS, 'cause it's more effective
[6/10/18, 4:44:20 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i took 6 hours to read through the chem notes

[6/10/18, 4:45:18 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: provenance tone purpose
[6/10/18, 4:45:17 PM] Yi Kai: I mean there's some things which are already completely drilled in though
[6/10/18, 4:45:21 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: content
[6/10/18, 4:45:22 PM] Yi Kai: Like the structure and bonding

[6/10/18, 4:45:58 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: true
[6/10/18, 4:46:13 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: at least we dont have bio
[6/10/18, 4:46:27 PM] Yi Kai: Yah
[6/10/18, 4:46:35 PM] Yi Kai: Just do SS first, you have Tuesday to do chem
[6/10/18, 4:46:45 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: tuesday need do physics
[6/10/18, 4:46:50 PM] Yi Kai: What have you not remembered for Chem?
[6/10/18, 4:47:01 PM] Yi Kai: There's nothing to mug for physics though...
[6/10/18, 4:47:02 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: atmosphere
[6/10/18, 4:47:16 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: im not like u in math
[6/10/18, 4:47:20 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: 🤕
[6/10/18, 4:47:49 PM] Yi Kai: Ok lol I gave someone else my atmosphere notes
[6/10/18, 4:47:58 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: why
[6/10/18, 4:48:01 PM] Yi Kai: 'Cause my atmosphere notes is only 2 pages

[6/10/18, 4:49:35 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: aha
[6/10/18, 4:49:38 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: actually u have to
[6/10/18, 4:49:42 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: if u care abt higher
[6/10/18, 4:50:09 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: tbh i should just give up on higher math
[6/10/18, 4:50:42 PM] Yi Kai: Higher math depends on skill if you ask me
[6/10/18, 4:50:49 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oops
[6/10/18, 4:51:09 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: limited skill
[6/10/18, 4:53:01 PM] Yi Kai: If you did more practices before then intuition will tell you to do the thing which will bring you to the answer
[6/10/18, 4:53:48 PM] Yi Kai: And also your checking strats. The thing I like about algebra is that you can just sub in to check if it's correct. For simplification just sub in 3 values around there. If it's correct, it's most likely done correctly
[6/10/18, 4:55:07 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oo
[6/10/18, 4:55:08 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ok thanks
[6/10/18, 5:50:00 PM] Yi Kai: And it’s more effective if you print it out just saying
[6/10/18, 6:22:52 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oh
[6/10/18, 6:22:57 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: but my printer v mafan to print sia
[6/10/18, 6:23:48 PM] Yi Kai: Cause if I use devices to view the document I tend to be more distracted
[6/10/18, 6:27:26 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: lol
[6/10/18, 6:27:28 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: same
‎[7/10/18, 1:26:57 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ‎image omitted
[7/10/18, 1:31:15 PM] Yi Kai: If it exerts smaller forces then it can expand more I guess
[7/10/18, 1:31:34 PM] Yi Kai: And it’s true because air molecules are less dense
[7/10/18, 1:31:48 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i put A though
[7/10/18, 1:32:06 PM] Yi Kai: I think I put C
[7/10/18, 1:32:22 PM] Yi Kai: It kind of doesn’t explain it directly lah
[7/10/18, 1:32:24 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i thought the kinetic energy would be the same
[7/10/18, 1:32:44 PM] Yi Kai: It’s different temperature usually
[7/10/18, 1:32:50 PM] Yi Kai: Unless evaporation
[7/10/18, 1:33:01 PM] Yi Kai: Cause one is above boiling point
[7/10/18, 1:33:01 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: they put over a temperature rangr
[7/10/18, 1:33:19 PM] Yi Kai: Oh yah
[7/10/18, 1:33:27 PM] Yi Kai: Then the KE should be the same oops
[7/10/18, 1:33:29 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ahh
[7/10/18, 1:33:39 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: hope fong doesnt set the paper
[7/10/18, 1:33:42 PM] Yi Kai: But that day I dao the quizzes cause I didn’t care
[7/10/18, 1:33:51 PM] Yi Kai: Sometimes his paper is doable actually
[7/10/18, 1:34:00 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: soMetImeS
[7/10/18, 1:34:10 PM] Yi Kai: Just that he likes making people think
[7/10/18, 1:34:17 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: lol
[7/10/18, 1:34:30 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i can hear your thoughts
[7/10/18, 1:46:02 PM] Yi Kai: ...
[7/10/18, 6:22:20 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: for purpose questions dont u start off with the author is trying to convince blablabla
[7/10/18, 6:22:34 PM] Yi Kai: Yah why?
[7/10/18, 6:22:46 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: how is that provenance
[7/10/18, 6:22:47 PM] Yi Kai: And also who he's trying to convince
[7/10/18, 6:22:57 PM] Yi Kai: Don't need to care about provenance tbh
[7/10/18, 6:23:08 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: cohens answers are weird
[7/10/18, 6:23:09 PM] Yi Kai: And for pcpt shouldn't tone come before purpose though
‎[7/10/18, 6:23:19 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ‎image omitted
[7/10/18, 6:23:25 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: wdym
[7/10/18, 6:23:28 PM] Yi Kai: Agreed. It's like his formats contradict the department's formats
[7/10/18, 6:23:43 PM] Yi Kai: I mean like should tone or purpose be mentioned first, in the answer
[7/10/18, 6:23:56 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: which answer
[7/10/18, 6:24:05 PM] Yi Kai: I couldn't find the answer for that one
[7/10/18, 6:24:30 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: .
[7/10/18, 6:24:32 PM] Yi Kai: Let me find
[7/10/18, 6:24:44 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i thought u only need to mention 1
[7/10/18, 6:24:45 PM] Yi Kai: https://classroom.google.com/u/1/c/MTAzODE1NjA4MDRa/a/MTQ4OTY1Nzg3MjRa/details
[7/10/18, 6:24:46 PM] Yi Kai: 1 b
[7/10/18, 6:24:57 PM] Yi Kai: Not sure if you can access the link though
[7/10/18, 6:26:32 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: purpose questions u dont have to mention tone what
[7/10/18, 6:28:08 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i think mugging cohens stutf will only make me more confused
[7/10/18, 6:28:09 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: wth
[7/10/18, 6:29:25 PM] Yi Kai: Sem
[7/10/18, 6:29:33 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: they are quite useless tbh
[7/10/18, 6:29:47 PM] Yi Kai: But then 1 c needs tone
[7/10/18, 6:29:51 PM] Yi Kai: And it's before the purpose
‎[7/10/18, 6:29:52 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ‎image omitted
[7/10/18, 6:30:05 PM] Yi Kai: It contradicts the department's notes
[7/10/18, 6:30:26 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i think he said
[7/10/18, 6:30:30 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: choose either one
[7/10/18, 6:30:39 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: 1 paragraph should be on content
[7/10/18, 6:30:49 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: the other is PCPT
[7/10/18, 6:30:59 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: but recommended to write purpose
[7/10/18, 6:34:10 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: what does chapter 1 and 2 of ss textbook have
[7/10/18, 6:34:15 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i cant find my ss textbook
[7/10/18, 6:34:17 PM] Yi Kai: Nothing much
[7/10/18, 6:34:23 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oh good
[7/10/18, 6:34:39 PM] Yi Kai: If Xiang Yang's notes doesn't cover it, I trust it's not impt
[7/10/18, 6:34:45 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: lol
[7/10/18, 6:34:47 PM] Yi Kai: Plus the notes were compiled by 5 ppl
[7/10/18, 6:34:51 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: did u cross refer to ss textbook alr
[7/10/18, 6:35:03 PM] Yi Kai: No
[7/10/18, 6:35:09 PM] Yi Kai: I didn't open ss textbook
[7/10/18, 6:35:18 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: that makes me feel better
[7/10/18, 6:35:22 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: for not having my ss textbook
[7/10/18, 6:35:29 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: golly
[7/10/18, 6:35:29 PM] Yi Kai: But I memorised xiang yang's notes alr
[7/10/18, 6:35:35 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oh
[7/10/18, 6:36:31 PM] Yi Kai: Avier wants me to be photographer for ura with some pubs member
[7/10/18, 6:36:40 PM] Yi Kai: But tbh I can't do it, I don't even have dslr
[7/10/18, 6:36:46 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: lol
[7/10/18, 6:36:49 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ask him for his camera
[7/10/18, 6:37:26 PM] Yi Kai: That's what I intend to do
[7/10/18, 6:37:41 PM] Yi Kai: But he's rather unwilling 'cause DSLR is not compulsory
[7/10/18, 6:38:49 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: then what r u gonna use to take pics
[7/10/18, 6:39:23 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: btw if the author is trying to criticise pap in his illustratiom
[7/10/18, 6:39:25 PM] Yi Kai: Maybe my parents digital camera
[7/10/18, 6:39:33 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: then the question is why did he make this illustration
[7/10/18, 6:39:33 PM] Yi Kai: He suggested using phone
[7/10/18, 6:39:42 PM] Yi Kai: To criticise pap
[7/10/18, 6:40:06 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: what if its to criticise pap so as to convince people to not vote for them
[7/10/18, 6:40:21 PM] Yi Kai: Oh yah true
[7/10/18, 6:40:31 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: is it criticise pap, then intended outcome convince people?
[7/10/18, 6:40:34 PM] Yi Kai: Maybe criticise pap to garner support for opposition parties
[7/10/18, 6:41:03 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i think the direct implication is the purpose
[7/10/18, 6:41:16 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: indirect is outcome
[7/10/18, 6:47:06 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: for reliability utility and surprise questions the conclusion do you need to compare all PCPT
‎[7/10/18, 6:59:54 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ‎image omitted
[7/10/18, 7:26:15 PM] Yi Kai: No, pcpt is only for comparison
[7/10/18, 7:26:24 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: nani
[7/10/18, 7:26:35 PM] Yi Kai: Use like cross-referencing and treat the source content, according to the department format
[7/10/18, 7:26:58 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: will prove wrong questions come out
[7/10/18, 7:27:00 PM] Yi Kai: Just compare a bit and check reliability for both
[7/10/18, 7:27:06 PM] Yi Kai: I heard it's sec 4 stuff
[7/10/18, 7:27:19 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oh good
[7/10/18, 7:27:28 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: nani
[7/10/18, 7:39:38 PM] Yi Kai: That's what I understand about how the question is supposed to be done
[7/10/18, 7:40:03 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i think ure supposed to evaluate reliability though
[7/10/18, 7:41:29 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: reliability qn confirm need to evaluatr
[7/10/18, 7:41:33 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: at conclusion
[7/10/18, 7:41:36 PM] Yi Kai: Yah, but need to state the differences to show why you cross-reference those parts
[7/10/18, 7:41:39 PM] Yi Kai: Yes
[7/10/18, 7:41:51 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: wdym
[7/10/18, 7:41:54 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: what differences
[7/10/18, 7:42:29 PM] Yi Kai: If source B proves source C wrong, they have to be different in the first place
[7/10/18, 7:43:02 PM] Yi Kai: Can't wait for my exams to be over tbh, sorry if that makes you salt
[7/10/18, 7:43:18 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: its ok
[7/10/18, 7:43:33 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: yeah
[7/10/18, 7:43:42 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: im talking abt conclusion
[7/10/18, 7:44:16 PM] Yi Kai: For reliability question?
[7/10/18, 7:44:27 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: and utility and surprise
[7/10/18, 7:44:42 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: if u dont evaluate reliability i dont think u can get L5
[7/10/18, 7:44:50 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: or L6 whatever is the maximum
[7/10/18, 7:45:04 PM] Yi Kai: Aiyah it's always better to just answer the question
[7/10/18, 7:45:10 PM] Yi Kai: Like one sentence
[7/10/18, 7:45:17 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: but its part of answering the question
[7/10/18, 7:48:09 PM] Yi Kai: Then you should include it since it's part of the answer?
[7/10/18, 7:48:18 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: yess
[7/10/18, 7:48:24 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: lol tyler though
[7/10/18, 7:54:28 PM] Yi Kai: Lol
[7/10/18, 7:56:49 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: how do u memorise xiangyangs notes
[7/10/18, 7:59:38 PM] Yi Kai: Why?
[7/10/18, 7:59:51 PM] Yi Kai: Memorise the examples more important, the explanation just roughly know
[7/10/18, 7:59:53 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i have 3 hours to memorise
[7/10/18, 8:00:00 PM] Yi Kai: Then you better start
[7/10/18, 8:00:11 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i spent like 2 hours trying to gifure out sbq
[7/10/18, 8:00:21 PM] Yi Kai: I can try to recite his notes rn if you want
[7/10/18, 8:00:38 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: lol
[7/10/18, 8:01:48 PM] Yi Kai: chap 3:
   role of govt:
   -internal security -> scdf
   -external security->rsn(navy)
   -ensuring justice->family justice courts-> personal protection order
   -goods and services->public transport->105 mrt stations, 4638 bus stops
   -protecting ppl's interests -> workright initiative + cpf

[7/10/18, 8:02:35 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: these 2 things contradict each other
[7/10/18, 8:02:42 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ^study all sources
[7/10/18, 8:03:08 PM] Yi Kai: They don't
[7/10/18, 8:03:19 PM] Yi Kai: Say like it disagrees with the statement that (content)
[7/10/18, 8:04:23 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: but here u need to begin with "I agree with..."
[7/10/18, 8:04:43 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oh does it mean
[7/10/18, 8:04:49 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: u must say what u agree with
[7/10/18, 8:04:56 PM] Yi Kai: Yes
[7/10/18, 8:05:00 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: chey
[7/10/18, 8:05:45 PM] Yi Kai: role of citizens:
-working for the good of society:
   -individual->a litter at a time by Ms Elisa Ng
   -informal group->Singaporean Mr Chua gave out N95 masks to public during haze to ensure ppl stay healthy
   -formal group->MINDS(Movement for Intellectually Disabled Singapore)
-providing feedback:
   -individual->singapore conversation, with more than 47000 participants
   -group->transient workers count too(TWC2) and HOME(Humanitarian Organisation of Migration Economics) feedbacked for improving foreign workers working conditions, and one day off every week
[7/10/18, 8:06:13 PM] Yi Kai: Then last one is like ensuring a sense of belonging, which comes from giving ppl a say, so it mentioned REACH(Reaching Everyone for Active Citizenry@Home)
[7/10/18, 8:06:28 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: how do u get the last 2 marks for study all sources
[7/10/18, 8:06:47 PM] Yi Kai: I would think I should evaluate the reliability of one source specifically
[7/10/18, 8:07:01 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: balanced conclusion seems harder to write
[7/10/18, 8:07:12 PM] Yi Kai: 'Cause the previous time I go and briefly do reliability one all sources to conclude, and he was like one source will do
[7/10/18, 8:07:33 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: so u say
[7/10/18, 8:09:10 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: source A agrees with the statement that ____, because it shows that ____, in source A, it states that ____, this shows that____. Source A is reliable/unreliable, then u use PCPT to evaluate
[7/10/18, 8:10:01 PM] Yi Kai: Reliability at the back though
[7/10/18, 8:10:06 PM] Yi Kai: Then why need PCPT leh?
[7/10/18, 8:10:20 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: wait if not how to evaluate
[7/10/18, 8:10:28 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: cross refer to other sources ah
[7/10/18, 8:10:32 PM] Yi Kai: Wait what do you use pcpt for?
[7/10/18, 8:10:49 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: evaluating reliability, comparison
[7/10/18, 8:12:07 PM] Yi Kai: Compare with statement?
[7/10/18, 8:12:29 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: but isnt it agree/disagree alr
[7/10/18, 8:13:06 PM] Yi Kai: Yah, that's why I don't get what you use pcpt for
[7/10/18, 8:13:26 PM] Yi Kai: Evaluating reliability doesn't use pcpt, at most it uses purpose and treatment of content
[7/10/18, 8:13:37 PM] Yi Kai: Comparison requires comparison with another source
[7/10/18, 8:13:44 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: huh
[7/10/18, 8:14:36 PM] Yi Kai: Evaluate reliability of one source, that one I get what you mean
[7/10/18, 8:14:46 PM] Yi Kai: But for comparison, what did you compare with?
[7/10/18, 8:15:00 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: comparison u need to compare 1 para of content
[7/10/18, 8:15:06 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: then 1 para of tone or purpose
[7/10/18, 8:15:35 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: omg are we not on the same page
[7/10/18, 8:16:23 PM] Yi Kai: Ok you're talking about study all sources, the conclusion right?
[7/10/18, 8:16:40 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: no
[7/10/18, 8:16:46 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: im not planning to write conclusion
[7/10/18, 8:17:05 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: im talking about like how do you evaluate reliability for 1 source
[7/10/18, 8:17:21 PM] Yi Kai: Oh...
[7/10/18, 8:17:48 PM] Yi Kai: Just do what the department calls treatment of source, where you check for biased views or hidden motives
‎[7/10/18, 8:18:09 PM] Yi Kai: ‎image omitted
[7/10/18, 8:20:54 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: thats tone and purpose alr what
[7/10/18, 8:31:10 PM] Yi Kai: Fine
[7/10/18, 8:31:14 PM] Yi Kai: I guess you could say that
[7/10/18, 8:31:23 PM] Yi Kai: 'Cause PCPT usually refers to the comparison
[7/10/18, 8:31:36 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oh
[7/10/18, 8:54:12 PM] Yi Kai: I'm literally slacking already
[7/10/18, 8:54:20 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: lol
[7/10/18, 8:54:27 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ure already done what
[7/10/18, 8:54:40 PM] Yi Kai: I'm just revising my past mistakes
[7/10/18, 8:54:41 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: whats the difference between the 8 and 12 mark questions
[7/10/18, 8:55:05 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: and does both require u to memorise stuff
[7/10/18, 8:55:21 PM] Yi Kai: From contextual knowledge
[7/10/18, 8:55:35 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: the 8 mark one?
[7/10/18, 8:55:40 PM] Yi Kai: But since contextual knowledge usually isn't enough, it's best to memorise stuff to get more contextual knowledge
[7/10/18, 8:55:44 PM] Yi Kai: Both
[7/10/18, 8:55:51 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ohh
[7/10/18, 8:55:52 PM] Yi Kai: But the 12 mark one needs a conclusion
[7/10/18, 8:56:30 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: if u dont get full marks for the 1st 2 para can u grt marks for conclusion
[7/10/18, 8:56:35 PM] Yi Kai: Economic social political environmental are impt keywords to think of points sometimes
[7/10/18, 8:56:47 PM] Yi Kai: Should be
[7/10/18, 8:57:04 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: how do u conclude though
[7/10/18, 9:01:13 PM] Yi Kai: I'm not that clear tbh
[7/10/18, 9:01:43 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: but if u memorise all the points then dunneed right
[7/10/18, 9:03:59 PM] Yi Kai: May need if they come out with stuff out of your scope
[7/10/18, 9:04:08 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oh dear
[7/10/18, 9:11:15 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: so
[7/10/18, 9:11:26 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: 12m essay is basically 8m essay with conclusion
[7/10/18, 9:11:26 PM] Yi Kai: Yah?
[7/10/18, 9:11:30 PM] Yi Kai: Yes
[7/10/18, 9:11:35 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: scam
[7/10/18, 9:11:42 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: how many marks is the whole paper
[7/10/18, 9:11:57 PM] Yi Kai: 55
[7/10/18, 9:12:20 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: let me calculate marks i need for a1
[7/10/18, 9:12:23 PM] Yi Kai: I have a feeling I told that before though
[7/10/18, 9:12:33 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: lol
[7/10/18, 9:12:44 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: n
[7/10/18, 9:13:20 PM] Yi Kai: https://classroom.google.com/u/1/c/MTAzODE1NjA4MDRa/a/MTcyNzE2MzU2NjRa/details
[7/10/18, 9:13:24 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i need 41/55
[7/10/18, 9:13:29 PM] Yi Kai: For SRQ 12m
[7/10/18, 9:13:41 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oh
[7/10/18, 9:14:19 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: how much is physics ct1 worth
[7/10/18, 9:14:21 PM] Yi Kai: Class test and common test same weightage?
[7/10/18, 9:14:23 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: 15?
[7/10/18, 9:14:26 PM] Yi Kai: Idk
[7/10/18, 9:14:31 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: class test 15% each
[7/10/18, 9:14:44 PM] Yi Kai: One is worth 15, one is worth 10, then practical is 5% for physics
[7/10/18, 9:14:53 PM] Yi Kai: The first 2 being term 2 and term 3 test
[7/10/18, 9:14:56 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i calculated with the marks on the progress report
[7/10/18, 9:15:12 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: which got pulled down because of the FA which i got 5/8 for
[7/10/18, 9:15:27 PM] Yi Kai: I need 45 sian
[7/10/18, 9:15:46 PM] Yi Kai: 'Cause one C6 one A1
[7/10/18, 9:15:56 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i need 76.5 for physics a1
[7/10/18, 9:16:00 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oh
[7/10/18, 9:16:09 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: im quite sure i was 1% away from ss exemption
[7/10/18, 9:16:14 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i got 78 and 80
[7/10/18, 9:16:14 PM] Yi Kai: Doable actually
[7/10/18, 9:16:22 PM] Yi Kai: Oh sike
[7/10/18, 9:16:32 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: sad life
[7/10/18, 9:17:16 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i need 75 for chem
[7/10/18, 9:18:00 PM] Yi Kai: That's acceptable lah...
[7/10/18, 9:18:06 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i need 74 for el
[7/10/18, 9:18:11 PM] Yi Kai: A1 once and you A1 overall quite good
[7/10/18, 9:18:12 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: this is fun actually
[7/10/18, 9:18:29 PM] Yi Kai: Wah lao why is all your subjects pre-tests overall A1
[7/10/18, 9:18:37 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: lol
[7/10/18, 9:18:40 PM] Yi Kai: And yet you narrowly missed out exemptions
[7/10/18, 9:18:51 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: its cause of my term 3 tbh
[7/10/18, 9:18:56 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i screwed up
[7/10/18, 9:19:22 PM] Yi Kai: Oh
[7/10/18, 9:19:28 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i need 73.5 for math
[7/10/18, 9:19:29 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ahh
[7/10/18, 9:19:36 PM] Yi Kai: Wth
[7/10/18, 9:19:43 PM] Yi Kai: No wonder you got so many exemptions last year
[7/10/18, 9:19:48 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: why
[7/10/18, 9:20:01 PM] Yi Kai: For me the gap between good subjects and not so good subjects are quite big
[7/10/18, 9:20:08 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oh lol
[7/10/18, 9:20:22 PM] Yi Kai: 'Cause everything can get average A1 usually can consider for exemption already
[7/10/18, 9:20:24 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: csc i need 17/30
[7/10/18, 9:20:33 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: thats better though
[7/10/18, 9:22:58 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: 125/160 for chinese
[7/10/18, 9:23:23 PM] Yi Kai: It's out of 200...
[7/10/18, 9:23:31 PM] Yi Kai: Did you forget about oral
[7/10/18, 9:23:48 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i assumed my oral was 25/40
[7/10/18, 9:24:16 PM] Yi Kai: Oh
[7/10/18, 10:50:22 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: what are the factors for conclusion
[7/10/18, 10:50:29 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: extent of impact, time,?
[7/10/18, 11:08:36 PM] Yi Kai: It’s up to you I Guess
[7/10/18, 11:08:42 PM] Yi Kai: Depends on the question also
[7/10/18, 11:08:55 PM] Yi Kai: It’s unlike CSC where there’s a standard list
[7/10/18, 11:09:05 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: nvm just smoke
[7/10/18, 11:09:14 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i summon all the evidence from my subconsciousness
[7/10/18, 11:09:24 PM] Yi Kai: Lol
[7/10/18, 11:09:31 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i legit didnt memorise
[7/10/18, 11:09:37 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: but they all look quite ok
[7/10/18, 11:09:46 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: just need to remember the main point
[7/10/18, 11:09:49 PM] Yi Kai: They’re not
[7/10/18, 11:10:29 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i didnt even use my ss file to mug
[7/10/18, 11:10:33 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: !
[8/10/18, 6:10:11 AM] Yi Kai: Wow
[8/10/18, 6:11:36 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: what do you write if the source is unreliable but gives a balanced point of view
[8/10/18, 6:11:45 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: for conclusion of surprise question
[8/10/18, 6:12:35 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: or basically when purpose tone provenance contradicts each other
[8/10/18, 6:31:17 AM] Yi Kai: Just say you are surprised cause based on the other sources content you expect something else
[8/10/18, 6:31:28 AM] Yi Kai: Then you will be surprised
[8/10/18, 6:34:44 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: isnt the last para only concerning the PCT
[8/10/18, 6:38:40 AM] Yi Kai: Yes, but I would still bother to conclude about whether I am surprised
[8/10/18, 6:38:57 AM] Yi Kai: What do you mean by this actually
[8/10/18, 6:41:05 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: like
[8/10/18, 6:41:33 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: wait actually nvm
[8/10/18, 6:41:51 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: cus i think ure supposed to compare the content of given source with tone provenance purpose
[8/10/18, 6:41:58 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: to see if it surprises u
[8/10/18, 6:42:21 AM] Yi Kai: Wait legit?
[8/10/18, 6:42:41 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: if not then what
[8/10/18, 6:43:25 AM] Yi Kai: Just check for like biased views or like hidden motives(purpose)
[8/10/18, 6:43:42 AM] Yi Kai: So it’s more of checking the purpose
[8/10/18, 6:44:01 AM] Yi Kai: What are we supposed to do for the utility question ah?
[8/10/18, 6:44:30 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: lol same thing i guess
[8/10/18, 6:44:38 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: para 1 explain given source
[8/10/18, 6:44:53 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: para 2 and 3 crossrefer, if it supports means useful
[8/10/18, 6:45:55 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: para 4 evaluate purpose tone provenance to check reliability. if reliable means its useful. if unreliable, limited usefulness as it only represents a small group of people, but still sheds light on a new perspectivr of the issue
[8/10/18, 6:48:16 AM] Yi Kai: Ok lol
[8/10/18, 6:49:19 AM] Yi Kai: I have never found NSL any more retarded. Right on the day when I’m later, they tell you there’s a track fault to delay the train 5 minutes.
Then they keep stopping in between stops saying the train ahead is still at next station
[8/10/18, 6:50:09 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oh no
[8/10/18, 6:50:15 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: are u going to be on time
[8/10/18, 6:51:25 AM] Yi Kai: I don’t know tbh
[8/10/18, 6:51:57 AM] Yi Kai: Leaving at home 6.30 should make me reach school by 7.30, but I’m not even at Yishun
[8/10/18, 6:53:42 AM] Yi Kai: Crap I might be late
[8/10/18, 6:54:30 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oh no
[8/10/18, 6:54:35 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: but its a valid reason though
[8/10/18, 6:55:30 AM] Yi Kai: If I start SS late then I a bit gg lah
[8/10/18, 6:55:47 AM] Yi Kai: If I reach after 8 I’m supposed to report at General office right
[8/10/18, 6:55:58 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: idk actually
[8/10/18, 6:56:04 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: maybe u should pm angsh
[8/10/18, 6:59:24 AM] Yi Kai: Hmm perhaps
[8/10/18, 6:59:42 AM] Yi Kai: What the actual, it’s still stopping between Yishun and Khatib
[8/10/18, 6:59:42 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i think there aee exam guidelines on iemb thoif h
[8/10/18, 6:59:46 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: let me check
[8/10/18, 6:59:51 AM] Yi Kai: Legit damn retarded siah
[8/10/18, 6:59:59 AM] Yi Kai: Are you still at home lol
[8/10/18, 7:00:12 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: im at hillview
[8/10/18, 7:00:20 AM] Yi Kai: Oh
[8/10/18, 7:01:28 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: it doesnt say
[8/10/18, 7:01:41 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: it only says if ure late for 30 minutes or more u have to go to the admin office
[8/10/18, 7:03:26 AM] Yi Kai: Ok thanks
[8/10/18, 7:03:43 AM] Yi Kai: My parents will probably pick me up somewhere cause they’re awake
[8/10/18, 7:07:57 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oh
[8/10/18, 6:01:16 PM] Yi Kai: Omg I just shot a bottle cap through a toilet roll
[8/10/18, 6:01:22 PM] Yi Kai: It was from 2.6m though
‎[8/10/18, 6:01:30 PM] Yi Kai: ‎image omitted
[8/10/18, 7:19:24 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: LOL
[8/10/18, 7:19:34 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: seems like u dont have enough exams to take
[8/10/18, 7:20:05 PM] Yi Kai: 👌
[8/10/18, 7:20:31 PM] Yi Kai: I've been watching youtube, tv and gaming for the whole day
[8/10/18, 7:20:37 PM] Yi Kai: Maybe I should be more productive tomorrow
[8/10/18, 7:21:27 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: h
[8/10/18, 7:21:32 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i was sleeping
[8/10/18, 7:21:58 PM] Yi Kai: Wow
[8/10/18, 7:37:25 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: good luck for bio
[8/10/18, 7:37:32 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i know ill be home sleeping
[8/10/18, 7:38:00 PM] Yi Kai: Lol same
[8/10/18, 7:38:32 PM] Yi Kai: I made a bet with Bernard that if he gets full marks for higher chem I'll treat him to a meal budget $10, and if I get 38++ for higher physics he'll treat me to a meal budget $3
[8/10/18, 7:38:49 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: lol
[8/10/18, 7:38:51 PM] Yi Kai: I'm still thinking about whether I should have done it
[8/10/18, 7:39:00 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i think u scammed him
[8/10/18, 7:39:09 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i dont think u can get full marks
[8/10/18, 7:39:14 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: he*
[8/10/18, 7:41:47 PM] Yi Kai: Exactly
[8/10/18, 7:41:56 PM] Yi Kai: I only did it 'cause he's like so confident
[8/10/18, 7:42:12 PM] Yi Kai: His reasoning is that if he can get full marks for exemption test, he can for higher paper
[8/10/18, 7:42:25 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: exemption test is so much easier
[8/10/18, 7:42:41 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i can get a1 for it doesnt mean i can also get a1 for higher chem
[8/10/18, 8:55:36 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: for math the yellow and green papers are not tested for normal paper right
[8/10/18, 9:01:21 PM] Yi Kai: Correct
[8/10/18, 9:01:54 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: yes
[8/10/18, 9:01:59 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: skip mugging
[9/10/18, 12:29:11 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: whats the difference between solutions and roots again
[9/10/18, 12:29:27 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: also some of the yellow math worksheets look like they can come out for normal math
[9/10/18, 12:29:52 PM] Yi Kai: Which ones?
[9/10/18, 12:30:02 PM] Yi Kai: I don't think there's a difference
[9/10/18, 12:30:20 PM] Yi Kai: I can only think of graph transformation, but they're also in the white worksheets
[9/10/18, 12:30:48 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: like transformation of graphs or something
[9/10/18, 12:30:52 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oh
[9/10/18, 12:31:06 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i thought maumu explain there was a difference though
[9/10/18, 12:31:17 PM] Yi Kai: Zeros (roots) of a function are the values of x for which f(x)=0 while solutions are the values of the x which make the equation f(x) = c true where c is any constant . for example if f(a) = 0 then a is called root and (a,0) called solution of f(x) while if f(b) = c then (b,c) is called solution.
[9/10/18, 12:31:25 PM] Yi Kai: From google
[9/10/18, 12:31:32 PM] Yi Kai: This kind of stuff I listen and forget
[9/10/18, 12:32:01 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: wait it must be at 0?
[9/10/18, 12:32:11 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: lol
[9/10/18, 12:33:17 PM] Yi Kai: For roots, yes
[9/10/18, 12:33:59 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oh so there will always be solutions but there may not be roots
[9/10/18, 12:34:03 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: real roots
[9/10/18, 12:37:28 PM] Yi Kai: Yah
[9/10/18, 12:37:58 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ok thanks
[9/10/18, 12:56:07 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: how do u differentiate between a condition and a resupt
[9/10/18, 12:56:15 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: is this only a maumu thing or what
[9/10/18, 12:57:45 PM] Yi Kai: Resupt?
[9/10/18, 12:57:58 PM] Yi Kai: Oh you mean result
[9/10/18, 12:58:26 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ya
‎[9/10/18, 12:58:52 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ‎image omitted
[9/10/18, 12:59:22 PM] Yi Kai: What did the qn ask for?
[9/10/18, 12:59:38 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: sketch
[9/10/18, 12:59:41 PM] Yi Kai: 'Cause usually label intercepts good enough
[9/10/18, 12:59:50 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: scamm
[9/10/18, 1:00:02 PM] Yi Kai: turning point is usually optional but good to write
[9/10/18, 1:00:04 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: but can u just sub the equation to find turning point in calculator
[9/10/18, 1:00:07 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: instead of showing working
[9/10/18, 1:00:12 PM] Yi Kai: Anyway it's a maumu thing to deny excess
[9/10/18, 1:00:26 PM] Yi Kai: ?
[9/10/18, 1:00:20 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oh
[9/10/18, 1:00:21 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: lol
[9/10/18, 1:00:32 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oh my its 100
[9/10/18, 1:00:32 PM] Yi Kai: Isn't that rather retarded
[9/10/18, 1:00:36 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: make a wish
[9/10/18, 1:00:40 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oh
[9/10/18, 1:00:45 PM] Yi Kai: ?
[9/10/18, 1:00:57 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: 100pm
[9/10/18, 1:01:08 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: 良辰已过
[9/10/18, 1:01:11 PM] Yi Kai: If <condition>, prove that <result>
[9/10/18, 1:01:19 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oh
[9/10/18, 1:01:19 PM] Yi Kai: Whatever it is it's show that <result>
[9/10/18, 1:01:25 PM] Yi Kai: Oh cheah
[9/10/18, 1:01:29 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: why did math turn into english
[9/10/18, 1:01:37 PM] Yi Kai: It didn't
[9/10/18, 1:01:56 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: so if they say sketch u dont have to show turning point
[9/10/18, 1:01:59 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: unless they ask ilfor it
[9/10/18, 1:03:08 PM] Yi Kai: What's the answer for physics higher paper questions 6 part e?
[9/10/18, 1:03:26 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: send q
[9/10/18, 1:03:28 PM] Yi Kai: Usually, it's just like that time in ct2 they asked to label intercept between 2 graphs, and turning points
‎[9/10/18, 1:04:04 PM] Yi Kai: ‎image omitted
[9/10/18, 1:04:17 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: and when they say this graph meets the other graph is it at 1 or 2 points
[9/10/18, 1:04:47 PM] Yi Kai: Depends
[9/10/18, 1:04:50 PM] Yi Kai: Can give example?
‎[9/10/18, 1:05:16 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ‎image omitted
[9/10/18, 1:05:27 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oops i didnt copy
[9/10/18, 1:06:27 PM] Yi Kai: Can be multiple
[9/10/18, 1:06:38 PM] Yi Kai: Like the graphs can meet at multiple points
[9/10/18, 1:06:41 PM] Yi Kai: nvm
[9/10/18, 1:06:46 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: when is it 1 point
[9/10/18, 1:07:14 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: is it tangent then is 1 point
[9/10/18, 1:07:26 PM] Yi Kai: When the question decides to use the singular form
[9/10/18, 1:07:46 PM] Yi Kai: Not necessary, if you want find the number of solutions just sketch graph
[9/10/18, 1:07:49 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: whats a singular form
[9/10/18, 1:07:51 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oh my
[9/10/18, 1:07:59 PM] Yi Kai: Find the value where they meet
[9/10/18, 1:08:10 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: and maumus way of marking makes me paranoid about my working
[9/10/18, 1:08:20 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oh
[9/10/18, 1:08:41 PM] Yi Kai: He just wants to make our presentation better
[9/10/18, 1:08:54 PM] Yi Kai: It’s his way of not giving me full marks if i did nothing wrong
[9/10/18, 1:08:59 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: sometimes i overly doubt myself
[9/10/18, 1:09:02 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: LOL
[9/10/18, 1:09:04 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: its ok
[9/10/18, 1:09:37 PM] Yi Kai: In CT2 I used the not equal sign and he just circled all of them saying poor presentation -1
[9/10/18, 1:09:46 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: wtf
[9/10/18, 1:10:01 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: then what are u supposed to write
[9/10/18, 1:10:04 PM] Yi Kai: Not like I can do anything
[9/10/18, 1:10:20 PM] Yi Kai: Use words and use equal sign to show that it’s the impossible case
[9/10/18, 1:10:29 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: lol
[9/10/18, 1:10:34 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i see

[20/10/18, 9:34:55 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: my main bag can fit everything lol
[20/10/18, 9:35:18 PM] Yi Kai: Lol maybe cause I brought extra stuff
[20/10/18, 9:35:19 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: so if i bring a daypack it will be even more empty

[28/10/18, 11:29:57 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: like all those things he said
[28/10/18, 11:30:11 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: he could have just kept his opinions to himself
[28/10/18, 11:30:28 AM] Yi Kai: And now we can report what he said
[28/10/18, 11:30:38 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i alr deleted the chat lol
[28/10/18, 11:30:39 AM] Yi Kai: Which screws him up quite badly, just that I won't do it

[28/10/18, 11:31:57 AM] Yi Kai: Bring laptop and code more games or play more games
[28/10/18, 11:32:08 AM] Yi Kai: I'm thinking about doing astroparty next
[28/10/18, 11:32:15 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: whats that
[28/10/18, 11:32:16 AM] Yi Kai: Then move on to multiplayer online games
[28/10/18, 11:32:22 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i feel bad for slacking
[28/10/18, 11:32:27 AM] Yi Kai: The thing with many jets turning and trying to shoot each other
[28/10/18, 11:32:32 AM] Yi Kai: Happens to me all the time
[28/10/18, 11:32:34 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oh

[28/10/18, 11:32:58 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: and idk what productive things to do
[28/10/18, 11:33:08 AM] Yi Kai: If not battleship, 'cause I can code a CPU player to play against me (I don't know how for astroparty or atomas)
[28/10/18, 11:33:33 AM] Yi Kai: Aiyah not like I'm productive, I code games because I know one game can occupy about 1 week for me
[28/10/18, 11:33:34 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: atomas is single player
[28/10/18, 11:33:47 AM] Yi Kai: But multiplayer games are more popular and more fun
[28/10/18, 11:33:55 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: lol
[28/10/18, 11:34:02 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: be a future games developer
[28/10/18, 11:34:02 AM] Yi Kai: Zhiheng's challenge to me was to code a cpu to play atomas
[28/10/18, 11:34:06 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: be the next supercell
[28/10/18, 11:34:07 AM] Yi Kai: Like what I did on flappy bird
[28/10/18, 11:34:13 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oh
[28/10/18, 11:34:15 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: thats cool
[28/10/18, 11:34:17 AM] Yi Kai: Lazy to learn more languages though
[28/10/18, 11:34:26 AM] Yi Kai: But I can't think of how to do it lol
[28/10/18, 11:34:27 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: idk any
[28/10/18, 11:34:39 AM] Yi Kai: Forgot all your cpp ah?
[28/10/18, 11:34:48 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: HMMM
[28/10/18, 11:34:51 AM] Yi Kai: I only know cpp and python, not even java (used for web games)
[28/10/18, 11:34:58 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: wasnt those we learnt damb basic
[28/10/18, 11:35:00 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: damn
[28/10/18, 11:35:05 AM] Yi Kai: I only remember 'cause I went NOI training and became damn zai
[28/10/18, 11:35:12 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: whats noi
[28/10/18, 11:35:14 AM] Yi Kai: It's the reason I survived sec 2 with ease
[28/10/18, 11:35:27 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: lower sec infocomm is a scam
[28/10/18, 11:35:29 AM] Yi Kai: National Olympiad in Informatics, the training quite cancer after the 1st 3 sessions
[28/10/18, 11:35:32 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: basically equivalent to csc
[28/10/18, 11:35:39 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: siao
[28/10/18, 11:35:41 AM] Yi Kai: Shao bing getting full marks for python lol
[28/10/18, 11:35:44 AM] Yi Kai: True
[28/10/18, 11:35:45 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: sounds advanced
[28/10/18, 11:36:03 AM] Yi Kai: Supposed to be advanced, the competition each school can only send 5 participants though
[28/10/18, 11:36:12 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oh
[28/10/18, 11:36:19 AM] Yi Kai: Which causes the number of competitors to be very limited, unlike math olympiad
[28/10/18, 11:36:21 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i kinda miss obs
[28/10/18, 11:36:35 AM] Yi Kai: Usually the coding zai ppl damn zai at math one(I considered noob alr)
[28/10/18, 11:36:42 AM] Yi Kai: Same siah, my group was so nice

[28/10/18, 11:37:20 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: half of the group i guess
[28/10/18, 11:37:41 AM] Yi Kai: Most of my group was like I feel happy I'm going home but sad that these 5 days ended so quickly
[28/10/18, 11:37:57 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i didnt wanna go hone
[28/10/18, 11:38:12 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: home

[28/10/18, 9:25:30 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ng siew hoon
[28/10/18, 9:31:36 PM] Yi Kai: Same
[31/10/18, 2:20:32 PM] Yi Kai: Any idea how atomas antimatter works?
[31/10/18, 2:21:44 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: it just removes half of the atoms
[31/10/18, 2:27:45 PM] Yi Kai: But how does it fuse them
[31/10/18, 2:28:00 PM] Yi Kai: Like how to create the last one, and how does it score
[31/10/18, 2:38:36 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: wdym
[31/10/18, 3:57:06 PM] Yi Kai: Like for dark plus it takes the best of first 2 plus 3, then continue to function as normal plus
[31/10/18, 3:57:15 PM] Yi Kai: But what about antimatter?
[31/10/18, 4:06:36 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: huh
[31/10/18, 4:06:41 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: antimatter is the powerup
[31/10/18, 4:06:48 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i mean not a powerup
[31/10/18, 4:07:04 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: once u use it it just removes half of the atoms on board
[31/10/18, 4:20:39 PM] Yi Kai: Like what do the atoms become?
[31/10/18, 4:20:41 PM] Yi Kai: Nothing?
[31/10/18, 4:22:52 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ya
[31/10/18, 4:22:53 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: deleted
[31/10/18, 4:23:02 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: its meant to save ur life
[31/10/18, 4:43:50 PM] Yi Kai: Ok lol
[31/10/18, 4:44:17 PM] Yi Kai: But I thought it combines into one bigger atom though
[31/10/18, 5:27:06 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: nope idts
[31/10/18, 5:27:25 PM] Yi Kai: Ok
[31/10/18, 6:02:36 PM] Yi Kai: Are you damn boliao now? If yes can I ask you to try to using up 6 red pluses in one move? 'Cause I intend to put that as one of the achievements in my version, but I can't even do it myself lol
[31/10/18, 6:03:24 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: lol
[31/10/18, 6:03:34 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: how do u use more than 1 plus in a move
[31/10/18, 6:06:49 PM] Yi Kai: Like you have 1 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6
[31/10/18, 6:07:03 PM] Yi Kai: Then if you react the first 2, they will react with the next one and so on
[31/10/18, 6:07:39 PM] Yi Kai: Doesn't have to be ascending order, but the atom must be adjacent to where the main stuff will be
[31/10/18, 6:09:37 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oh lol
[31/10/18, 6:09:39 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: let me try
[31/10/18, 6:09:43 PM] Yi Kai: Like you get what I mean? I was intending to have one achievement 6 and one on 8
[31/10/18, 6:09:49 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: yeah
[31/10/18, 6:09:59 PM] Yi Kai: But I couldn't do 6 so I reduced it to 4 and 6, my best was using up 5
[31/10/18, 6:10:27 PM] Yi Kai: Then all achievements reward antimatter, that's why I asked about antimatter
[31/10/18, 6:12:36 PM] Yi Kai: I've been trying for one hour
[31/10/18, 6:12:49 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: lol wts
[31/10/18, 6:13:16 PM] Yi Kai: Like I keep dying
[31/10/18, 6:14:15 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i just did a 5
[31/10/18, 6:14:24 PM] Yi Kai: Wow ok...
[31/10/18, 6:14:33 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: phosporus to calcium
[31/10/18, 6:14:39 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: how do u get 6 diffferent atoms though
[31/10/18, 6:14:39 PM] Yi Kai: I really feel like doubting the website now
[31/10/18, 6:14:48 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: wdym
[31/10/18, 6:14:49 PM] Yi Kai: Just spam react
[31/10/18, 6:15:03 PM] Yi Kai: It says that the game will spawn a plus once every 5 moves
[31/10/18, 6:15:11 PM] Yi Kai: Now for once, I feel like I need more pluses in the game
[31/10/18, 6:15:41 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oh
[31/10/18, 6:15:44 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: let me try again
[31/10/18, 6:15:47 PM] Yi Kai: Quite sure that's 6?
[31/10/18, 6:15:57 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: 15 to 20
[31/10/18, 6:15:58 PM] Yi Kai: 15 + 15 + 16 + 17 + 18 + 19 + 20
[31/10/18, 6:16:07 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: as in everything combines to form 20
[31/10/18, 6:16:13 PM] Yi Kai: Oh
[31/10/18, 6:16:40 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i need more minuses
[31/10/18, 6:16:57 PM] Yi Kai: Lol
[31/10/18, 6:17:03 PM] Yi Kai: Minuses is once every 20 moves
[31/10/18, 6:18:26 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oops
[31/10/18, 6:19:12 PM] Yi Kai: Ugh this thing is so freakin' hard siah
[31/10/18, 6:19:23 PM] Yi Kai: Maybe I should award 2 antimatter instead of 1
[31/10/18, 6:19:24 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i just died
[31/10/18, 6:19:29 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: lol
[31/10/18, 6:19:32 PM] Yi Kai: I died at least 15 times lol
[31/10/18, 6:19:38 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: u cant get the extra antimatter if u cant do it anyways
[31/10/18, 6:19:48 PM] Yi Kai: True
[31/10/18, 6:20:13 PM] Yi Kai: To use 6 pluses, the preparation already takes 12 atoms, which only leaves you with 6 atoms worth of breathing space
[31/10/18, 6:20:29 PM] Yi Kai: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTPW_cIYp9o
[31/10/18, 6:22:12 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: LOL
[31/10/18, 6:22:14 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: is that her pig
[31/10/18, 6:22:40 PM] Yi Kai: Yep
[31/10/18, 6:22:49 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: lol wth
[31/10/18, 6:22:54 PM] Yi Kai: A repeated 35 second video throughout the whole thing
[31/10/18, 6:23:07 PM] Yi Kai: Except that it's bigger now
[31/10/18, 6:23:17 PM] Yi Kai: She shared on instagram story once but I don't think I downloaded it
[31/10/18, 6:23:22 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oh
[31/10/18, 6:23:25 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: lmao
[31/10/18, 6:23:28 PM] Yi Kai: Pig username on instagram is realpiggysmallz
[31/10/18, 6:23:51 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: questionable
[31/10/18, 6:24:01 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: joyces dog has an instagram too
[31/10/18, 6:24:28 PM] Yi Kai: Omg that was so stupid
[31/10/18, 6:24:37 PM] Yi Kai: I just needed one more plus to complete the whole thing
[31/10/18, 6:24:41 PM] Yi Kai: but I died
[31/10/18, 6:24:46 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oh
[31/10/18, 6:24:56 PM] Yi Kai: Nvm eating dinner now bye
[31/10/18, 6:24:58 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: im still trying
[31/10/18, 6:25:09 PM] Yi Kai: Lol I guess I'll try for up to a week before changing the number
[31/10/18, 6:26:02 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: siao
[31/10/18, 6:26:06 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: thats a lot of time
[31/10/18, 6:42:58 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: crap im one plus away
‎[31/10/18, 6:43:33 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ‎image omitted
[31/10/18, 6:48:52 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: omg i give up
[31/10/18, 6:56:48 PM] Yi Kai: 2 actually lol
[31/10/18, 6:57:13 PM] Yi Kai: One before the beryllium and one between the lithium’s
[31/10/18, 6:57:25 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oh ya
[31/10/18, 7:57:02 PM] Yi Kai: I succeeded lol
‎[31/10/18, 8:00:55 PM] Yi Kai: ‎video omitted
[31/10/18, 8:12:33 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: wow
[31/10/18, 8:12:37 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: wts
[31/10/18, 8:14:58 PM] Yi Kai: Basically when I got the 11 2 3 4 5 6 stuff I had nothing else
[31/10/18, 8:15:01 PM] Yi Kai: So I was quite safe
[31/10/18, 8:15:54 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i had that once
[31/10/18, 8:15:59 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: then it didnt give me any plus
[31/10/18, 8:16:15 PM] Yi Kai: Oh lol
[31/10/18, 8:16:27 PM] Yi Kai: pH2: Create HCl-> award
pH7: Create H2O
pH 12: create KOH-> award
Risk taker I: create a chain reaction with 14 atoms->award
Risk taker II: create a chain reaction with 16 atoms with 3000 points->award
Highscorer I: Score 25000->award
Highscorer II: Score 35000->award
Big reaction I:Use at least 4 pluses in a reaction -> award
Big reaction II: Use at least 6 pluses in a reaction(9 normal atoms +8 pluses)->award
Positivivity: Have 12 plus atoms on board->award
Emptiness: Clear the whole game field->award

My current list of achievements now
[31/10/18, 8:17:16 PM] Yi Kai: I have proven the chain reaction stuff possible, also the big reaction stuff. Emptiness is officially in the game so doesn't matter, then the 12 pluses one I want to reconsider
[31/10/18, 8:17:31 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: lol
[31/10/18, 8:17:37 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: how do u clear the whole field
[31/10/18, 8:17:48 PM] Yi Kai: It's in the official game
[31/10/18, 8:17:58 PM] Yi Kai: Basically you need to react everything into one atom, then get a minus
[31/10/18, 8:18:08 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oh
[31/10/18, 8:18:35 PM] Yi Kai: Like when I was trying out my dark pluses I put the chances of it spawning as 50%, so I successfully did that and also realised a few bugs when the field is emptier
[31/10/18, 8:18:57 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: at least u have something to do
[31/10/18, 8:19:03 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: damn boring
[31/10/18, 8:19:06 PM] Yi Kai: Try surviv.io
[31/10/18, 8:19:11 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: avtually i need to do cep and spring cleaning
[31/10/18, 8:19:12 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: but lazy
[31/10/18, 8:19:25 PM] Yi Kai: What to do about spring cleaning lol?
[31/10/18, 8:19:33 PM] Yi Kai: And what's your cep going to be about?
[31/10/18, 8:19:38 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i need to actually know whats happening
[31/10/18, 8:19:45 PM] Yi Kai: Splix.io also fun
[31/10/18, 8:19:52 PM] Yi Kai: Like the procedures?
[31/10/18, 8:19:54 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: conducting science activities for p5 p6 kids
[31/10/18, 8:19:56 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ya
[31/10/18, 8:20:26 PM] Yi Kai: ...

Is that a carry on one?
[31/10/18, 8:20:34 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: nope
[31/10/18, 8:21:11 PM] Yi Kai: It's a rather dope idea just saying
[31/10/18, 8:21:18 PM] Yi Kai: But y'all want do it in school?
[31/10/18, 8:21:23 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: lol why
[31/10/18, 8:21:29 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: we doing it at some cdac
[31/10/18, 8:21:42 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: at tampines though everyone lives in the west so that sucks
[31/10/18, 8:21:43 PM] Yi Kai: It's just a bit weird, yet quite standard
[31/10/18, 8:21:56 PM] Yi Kai: Oh
[31/10/18, 8:22:06 PM] Yi Kai: Bukit panjang in the west meh?
[31/10/18, 8:22:12 PM] Yi Kai: Isn't it more in central
[31/10/18, 8:22:12 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ya
[31/10/18, 8:22:21 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: not rlly central tbh
[31/10/18, 8:22:23 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: its quite ulu
[31/10/18, 8:22:36 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: at least im in the more ulu part
[31/10/18, 8:23:06 PM] Yi Kai: Lol ok
[31/10/18, 8:25:09 PM] Yi Kai: I keep forgetting I have an undo function
[31/10/18, 8:33:05 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: hmm
[31/10/18, 8:33:27 PM] Yi Kai: Like it may change proton number, but whether it's a + or - won't change
[31/10/18, 8:49:13 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i thought it will always stay the same
[31/10/18, 8:53:16 PM] Yi Kai: Supposed to
[31/10/18, 8:53:28 PM] Yi Kai: But I lazy to do anything about it lol
[31/10/18, 8:53:58 PM] Yi Kai: 'Cause when you have stuff like dark pluses or neutrinos which can only spawn if the score hits the requirement
[31/10/18, 9:29:41 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oh
‎[31/10/18, 10:14:47 PM] Yi Kai: ‎image omitted
[31/10/18, 10:17:26 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ooo
[31/10/18, 10:17:42 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: cool
[31/10/18, 10:18:16 PM] Yi Kai: 'Cause I had a perfect symmetry except for 2 highest ones, then I got a dark plus
[31/10/18, 10:18:42 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oh
[31/10/18, 10:18:49 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i wanna sleeo
[31/10/18, 10:18:51 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: sleep
[31/10/18, 10:19:16 PM] Yi Kai: Go sleep lah
[31/10/18, 10:19:17 PM] Yi Kai: Sleep early
[31/10/18, 10:19:44 PM] Yi Kai: I intending to sleep around this time, but in the end I always end up sleeping at 11
[31/10/18, 11:08:48 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: lol
[1/11/18, 5:17:18 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: is there a specific attire for tmr ispark stuff
[1/11/18, 7:04:45 PM] Yi Kai: Don’t have
[1/11/18, 7:04:50 PM] Yi Kai: Dress down
[1/11/18, 7:05:00 PM] Yi Kai: And iSpark is not ProEd lol
[1/11/18, 7:12:28 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oh yay
[1/11/18, 7:45:41 PM] Yi Kai: I think I'll make my antimatter such that you can delete up to 10 atoms of your choice, and then double the scoring for the next 5 moves
[1/11/18, 8:07:43 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oo
[1/11/18, 8:07:50 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ure still doing the code lol
[1/11/18, 8:11:57 PM] Yi Kai: Yah
[1/11/18, 8:12:33 PM] Yi Kai: I mean like I like the whole game anyway, and creating more functions means that I can have more stuff to play
[1/11/18, 8:18:50 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: advantages of knowing how to code
[1/11/18, 8:29:12 PM] Yi Kai: ...
[1/11/18, 8:29:34 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: awat
[1/11/18, 8:29:40 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ura tmr hmm
[1/11/18, 8:30:29 PM] Yi Kai: ?
[1/11/18, 8:30:36 PM] Yi Kai: You're playing right?
[1/11/18, 8:30:43 PM] Yi Kai: 'Cause I'm going off early anyway
[1/11/18, 8:40:16 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: yeah
[1/11/18, 8:51:07 PM] Yi Kai: Check out a game called surviv.io
[1/11/18, 8:51:10 PM] Yi Kai: It's quite nice
[1/11/18, 9:17:49 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: lol idk hoe to play
[1/11/18, 9:17:50 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i keep dying
[1/11/18, 9:38:51 PM] Yi Kai: Not like I'm good at it anyway
[1/11/18, 9:53:16 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: im addicted
[1/11/18, 10:12:19 PM] Yi Kai: To what?
[1/11/18, 10:12:21 PM] Yi Kai: surviv.io?
[1/11/18, 10:12:25 PM] Yi Kai: Me too lol
[1/11/18, 10:16:16 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ya
[1/11/18, 10:16:27 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: are u playing
[1/11/18, 10:20:06 PM] Yi Kai: No
[1/11/18, 10:20:13 PM] Yi Kai: But if you want I can play with you like now
[1/11/18, 10:20:45 PM] Yi Kai: But then the creating team function never works
[1/11/18, 10:21:53 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: lol nvm
[1/11/18, 10:22:04 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: omg i procrastinated for another day again
[1/11/18, 10:27:58 PM] Yi Kai: Don't tell me I just teamed with you lol
[1/11/18, 10:28:47 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: huh
[1/11/18, 10:28:56 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: im not plauing
[1/11/18, 10:28:56 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: why
[1/11/18, 10:29:12 PM] Yi Kai: Ok lol
[1/11/18, 10:29:19 PM] Yi Kai: 'Cause I just had a 3-way team
[1/11/18, 10:29:27 PM] Yi Kai: Which got crushed by another pro player
[1/11/18, 10:58:23 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: hmm
[1/11/18, 11:09:29 PM] Yi Kai: Now my atomas is damn broken
[1/11/18, 11:10:07 PM] Yi Kai: By achieving all the achievements, you can get like 3300 points, just that one needs at least 25000 points to achieve and another one needs exactly 10000 points
[1/11/18, 11:11:09 PM] Yi Kai: Ok now I still need to figure out what to do about the antimatter, maybe I should dao that part
[1/11/18, 11:21:52 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: huh
[1/11/18, 11:21:54 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: what points
[2/11/18, 6:28:59 AM] Yi Kai: Score
[2/11/18, 6:29:22 AM] Yi Kai: Cause I award 300 points for each achievement
[2/11/18, 6:36:05 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oh
[2/11/18, 6:47:39 AM] Yi Kai: I guess I just anyhow combine half the board for antimatter cause I’m lazy
[2/11/18, 6:48:04 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: lol
[2/11/18, 6:48:09 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: thats how it works anyways
[2/11/18, 6:48:17 AM] Yi Kai: True
[2/11/18, 6:48:32 AM] Yi Kai: Should I just choose to believe the unofficial wikia
[2/11/18, 6:48:56 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: which is what
[2/11/18, 6:56:02 AM] Yi Kai: You take the one next to the antimatter (can’t remember left or right) and then add 2 to get the result for the first 2, then for the rest just add 1 at each stage
[2/11/18, 6:56:19 AM] Yi Kai: But I find that quite a scam and unbelievable, so I’ll just change it a bit
[2/11/18, 7:13:53 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: wat
[2/11/18, 7:16:06 AM] Yi Kai: Antimatter - Combines more than two atoms; in fact, it combines at least half of them into one atom. Like the Dark Plus, this nets an atom of the highest one +3. This can be manually triggered by tapping its respective button at the top of the screen, but it is in a limited supply. More can be bought through in-app purchases.
[2/11/18, 7:17:20 AM] Yi Kai: Wait wow it changed, cause it’s a wikia
[2/11/18, 7:17:38 AM] Yi Kai: This one is the one which Huiyan thinks is the one used
[2/11/18, 7:20:50 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: hmm
[2/11/18, 7:20:56 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: eoy results on isp alr
[2/11/18, 7:27:15 AM] Yi Kai: Ok I’ll go check
[2/11/18, 7:29:05 AM] Yi Kai: Ugh 74 for oral communication
[2/11/18, 7:29:55 AM] Yi Kai: Wot 100 for chem practical test
[2/11/18, 8:00:09 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: lll
[2/11/18, 8:00:10 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i got 99
[3/11/18, 6:53:19 PM] Yi Kai: I feel like I legit want to pon UR siah
[3/11/18, 7:03:31 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: lol why
[3/11/18, 7:03:49 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i feel like ive been conned into signing up for ai
[3/11/18, 9:20:18 PM] Yi Kai: Why?
[3/11/18, 9:20:25 PM] Yi Kai: Not like there’s anything to do
[3/11/18, 9:20:54 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: theres a camp we need to go
[3/11/18, 9:21:13 PM] Yi Kai: When?
[3/11/18, 9:21:29 PM] Yi Kai: I think I’m overseas lol

[3/11/18, 9:22:02 PM] Yi Kai: Yah I’m overseas lol
[3/11/18, 9:22:08 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ee
[3/11/18, 9:23:55 PM] Yi Kai: That’s why it’s also good to be overseas
[3/11/18, 9:26:29 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: walao

[4/11/18, 4:16:12 PM] Yi Kai: How I know
[4/11/18, 4:16:33 PM] Yi Kai: I don't even know what Avier did tbh, all I did was to update exco stuff and officer ranks on the website
[4/11/18, 4:21:29 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: lol
[4/11/18, 4:21:38 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: logs basically just spring cleaning

[4/11/18, 7:08:58 PM] Yi Kai: Oh wow
[4/11/18, 7:09:06 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: its probably for discussion of what to do for our exco term
[4/11/18, 7:09:10 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: which means no maumu
[4/11/18, 7:09:12 PM] Yi Kai: Don’t reveal my Instagram account if you find out my username anyway
[4/11/18, 7:09:20 PM] Yi Kai: True
[4/11/18, 7:09:26 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: anyways if hes there then its damn weird cause hes gonna review everything again during agm
[4/11/18, 7:09:31 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ok
[4/11/18, 7:09:37 PM] Yi Kai: True
[4/11/18, 7:09:53 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: we just stepped into exco so we havent really done much yet
[4/11/18, 7:09:56 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: hmm
[4/11/18, 7:10:01 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: im not gonna do the slides lol
[4/11/18, 7:10:06 PM] Yi Kai: ...

‎[4/11/18, 9:08:06 PM] Yi Kai: ‎image omitted
[4/11/18, 9:53:23 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oh
[4/11/18, 9:53:28 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: positivity a bit impossible
[4/11/18, 9:53:43 PM] Yi Kai: I mean I basically made all the atomas achievements more extreme
[4/11/18, 9:53:54 PM] Yi Kai: Exact scorer also quite damn impossible
[4/11/18, 9:54:14 PM] Yi Kai: But if you fail halfway you can always use antimatter lol
[4/11/18, 9:54:42 PM] Yi Kai: But the key is to achieve them early in the game, 'cause antimatter isn't saved to the next game
[4/11/18, 9:54:59 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: wdym
[4/11/18, 9:55:18 PM] Yi Kai: Like in earlier game you don't mind dying anyway, so try to get the achievements first
[4/11/18, 9:55:35 PM] Yi Kai: And all the pH stuff needs the hydrogen one, and if you keep hydrogen too long it's rather annoying
[4/11/18, 9:55:49 PM] Yi Kai: 'Cause they may spawn it sometimes if you keep it
[4/11/18, 9:55:51 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oh
[4/11/18, 9:56:09 PM] Yi Kai: Then the big reaction 2 thing is not worth to me
[4/11/18, 9:56:01 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: so u cant collect antimatter
[4/11/18, 9:56:27 PM] Yi Kai: Yah, but now I have like 6 to use in one game
[4/11/18, 9:56:33 PM] Yi Kai: And that's like whoa...
[4/11/18, 9:56:43 PM] Yi Kai: I can make a game run practically forever already
[4/11/18, 9:57:01 PM] Yi Kai: But achievements can be re-achieved, that's the good part
[4/11/18, 9:57:21 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: lol thats a lot
[4/11/18, 9:57:29 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: have u prepared for tmrs ss meeting
[4/11/18, 9:57:42 PM] Yi Kai: What to prepare actually?
[4/11/18, 9:57:47 PM] Yi Kai: Like Avier told me nothing
[4/11/18, 9:58:06 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ikr
[4/11/18, 9:58:15 PM] Yi Kai: And I don't think Weihan knows anything, so I'll just assume they know what to do
[4/11/18, 9:58:23 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i think we just basically smoke what we want to do next year
[4/11/18, 9:58:33 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: im not really gonna prepare for it

[5/11/18, 7:54:30 AM] Yi Kai: What happens if I’m late by like 2 minutes?
[5/11/18, 7:55:00 AM] Yi Kai: Cause by leaving house now and considering that MRT quite jammed at this time I’m quite screwed

[7/1/19, 4:17:14 PM] Yi Kai: Ok lol
[9/1/19, 9:41:35 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: did u start on the new math ws alr
[9/1/19, 9:41:45 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: is getting 1 answer for x correct for q1
[9/1/19, 9:41:48 PM] Yi Kai: Finished
[9/1/19, 9:42:19 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: how do u know if theres multiple answers for x
[9/1/19, 9:42:38 PM] Yi Kai: The range
[9/1/19, 9:42:51 PM] Yi Kai: On step 3 what's the range you got?
[9/1/19, 9:43:00 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: -50 to 670
[9/1/19, 9:43:10 PM] Yi Kai: Exactly
[9/1/19, 9:43:21 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: huh
[9/1/19, 9:43:23 PM] Yi Kai: If you add 360 to an angle, it's the same angle, same trigo ratios
[9/1/19, 9:43:26 PM] Yi Kai: But different answers
[9/1/19, 9:43:36 PM] Yi Kai: It's a range of 2 cycles of 360
[9/1/19, 9:43:57 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: u mean add 360 to x ah
[9/1/19, 9:47:34 PM] Yi Kai: Yah
[9/1/19, 9:47:47 PM] Yi Kai: Sorry I mean for the 2x-50
[9/1/19, 9:48:15 PM] Yi Kai: Finished full u lol
[9/1/19, 9:48:52 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: so u keep modding 360 for 2x-50 until cannot ah
[9/1/19, 9:49:04 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: lol i gave up trying to pin it nice
[9/1/19, 9:49:16 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: the name tag side looks like crap
[9/1/19, 9:49:26 PM] Yi Kai: Lol same
[9/1/19, 9:49:37 PM] Yi Kai: Once the name tag isn't straight the whole side looks bad
[9/1/19, 9:49:45 PM] Yi Kai: Yah basically
[9/1/19, 9:49:55 PM] Yi Kai: Anyway in the first place it's 2 answers
[9/1/19, 9:50:09 PM] Yi Kai: Negative tangent value means 2nd 4th quadrant
[9/1/19, 9:50:14 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ohh
[9/1/19, 9:50:31 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: but can have more cycles what
[9/1/19, 9:50:45 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: and the 2 badges inbetween the nametag and td gold and hfs
[9/1/19, 9:50:45 PM] Yi Kai: Then the other side is like 2 badges are quite tilted but I just dao
[9/1/19, 9:50:52 PM] Yi Kai: Lol
[9/1/19, 9:51:05 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: who thought of the badge arrangement
[9/1/19, 9:51:08 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: eeeyr
[9/1/19, 9:51:12 PM] Yi Kai: Lol same
[9/1/19, 9:51:17 PM] Yi Kai: But at least lesser badges to pin
[9/1/19, 9:51:22 PM] Yi Kai: At least no need leave blank
[9/1/19, 9:51:29 PM] Yi Kai: If not it's like broken badge
[9/1/19, 9:51:34 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: lol
[9/1/19, 9:51:36 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ya
[9/1/19, 9:51:48 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: convenience > appearance
[9/1/19, 9:51:58 PM] Yi Kai: Is Fu Xiang going to ask us to donate the badges
[9/1/19, 9:52:01 PM] Yi Kai: Now I don't mind
[9/1/19, 9:52:11 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: lol idt u can donate now
[9/1/19, 9:52:19 PM] Yi Kai: Just do it informally lol

[9/1/19, 9:52:48 PM] Yi Kai: 😂
[9/1/19, 9:52:54 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: u need to pin them
[9/1/19, 9:53:11 PM] Yi Kai: Like if I donate extra uniforms informally what happens
[9/1/19, 9:53:25 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: nothing
[9/1/19, 9:53:35 PM] Yi Kai: I meant like the stuff we don't need for new arrangement, like CP CC RS CSSP ATC
[9/1/19, 9:53:46 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oh
[9/1/19, 9:53:49 PM] Yi Kai: But I'm keeping the ranks
[9/1/19, 9:53:52 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: he will probably ask u to keep incase u break

[9/1/19, 9:54:48 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: cause there was too much trash in my drawer
[9/1/19, 9:54:50 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: why
[9/1/19, 9:55:47 PM] Yi Kai: lol
[9/1/19, 9:55:57 PM] Yi Kai: I don't know, I don't think I have the cert as well

[9/1/19, 9:56:11 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: !
[9/1/19, 9:56:23 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: silver probably looks better than gold though
[9/1/19, 9:57:05 PM] Yi Kai: I mean the first badge is free so I don't really care...
[9/1/19, 9:57:10 PM] Yi Kai: And I don't break badges
[9/1/19, 9:57:18 PM] Yi Kai: For marksman there's no replacement one I think
[9/1/19, 9:57:31 PM] Yi Kai: 'Cause it's the only badge that feels like it's breaking
[9/1/19, 9:57:52 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: same
[9/1/19, 9:58:06 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: for mine its stc

[9/1/19, 10:03:02 PM] Yi Kai: 2 solutions
[9/1/19, 10:03:13 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: is one of them 30
[9/1/19, 10:03:14 PM] Yi Kai: positive tangent got how many quadrants?
[9/1/19, 10:03:21 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: 2
[9/1/19, 10:03:21 PM] Yi Kai: Yes
[9/1/19, 10:03:34 PM] Yi Kai: Then how many solution ah
[9/1/19, 10:03:42 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: but 60 + 360 is 420
[9/1/19, 10:03:58 PM] Yi Kai: That's now what you're supposed to do
[9/1/19, 10:04:07 PM] Yi Kai: The range has only 1 cycle of 360 so adding 360 won't work
[9/1/19, 10:04:17 PM] Yi Kai: Based on the different quadrants
[9/1/19, 10:04:22 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: omg
[9/1/19, 10:04:30 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: so 180?
[9/1/19, 10:04:41 PM] Yi Kai: Yah you could say that
[9/1/19, 10:04:47 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: then why doesnt e1 have 4 solutions
[9/1/19, 10:05:03 PM] Yi Kai: 'Cause +36
[9/1/19, 10:05:06 PM] Yi Kai: 360*
[9/1/19, 10:05:13 PM] Yi Kai: So each solution breeds another
[9/1/19, 10:06:07 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: im fainting
[9/1/19, 10:07:48 PM] Yi Kai: Why
[9/1/19, 10:07:55 PM] Yi Kai: I feel like fainting because I'm tired

[14/1/19, 10:33:38 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: rmb bring my math ws ah
[14/1/19, 10:41:18 PM] Yi Kai: I will
[14/1/19, 10:41:26 PM] Yi Kai: Kohkt c++ sabbat trainer
[14/1/19, 10:41:34 PM] Yi Kai: He booked me and bernard this year and last year
[14/1/19, 10:41:51 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oh
[14/1/19, 10:41:53 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oh no
[14/1/19, 10:42:06 PM] Yi Kai: I'm just stuck now
[14/1/19, 10:42:15 PM] Yi Kai: My feelings strongly tell me not to go
‎[14/1/19, 10:42:18 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ‎image omitted
[14/1/19, 10:42:28 PM] Yi Kai: But then the portfolio advantage also tells me to go
[14/1/19, 10:42:32 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: when the fe3+ ion is in FeCl3 which is a solid
[14/1/19, 10:42:37 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: go for which one
[14/1/19, 10:43:49 PM] Yi Kai: Iron 3 + electron become iron 2?
[14/1/19, 10:43:55 PM] Yi Kai: I know what you mean
[14/1/19, 10:43:57 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ya
[14/1/19, 10:44:03 PM] Yi Kai: Chem olympiad
[14/1/19, 10:44:08 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: just separate it ah
[14/1/19, 10:44:12 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oh lol
[14/1/19, 10:44:11 PM] Yi Kai: As in isn't that the half equation?
[14/1/19, 10:44:29 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: but its solid forn so idk if can separate
[14/1/19, 10:44:52 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i dont think u can go if ure already prebooked
[14/1/19, 10:45:03 PM] Yi Kai: Fair enough
[14/1/19, 10:45:14 PM] Yi Kai: Dao lah
[14/1/19, 10:45:26 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: okok
[14/1/19, 10:45:27 PM] Yi Kai: If you want then just don't put iron put iron chloride lorh
[14/1/19, 10:45:30 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: at most she say i fumble
[14/1/19, 10:45:39 PM] Yi Kai: Lol
[14/1/19, 10:45:57 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: then the state for Fe3+ write what
[14/1/19, 10:45:59 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: aq ag
[14/1/19, 10:46:00 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ah
[14/1/19, 10:46:24 PM] Yi Kai: Isn't it solid?
[14/1/19, 10:46:48 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: wait LOL
[14/1/19, 10:46:58 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: the question writes aqueous for both
[14/1/19, 10:47:04 PM] Yi Kai: Oh
[14/1/19, 10:47:08 PM] Yi Kai: Then aq lorh
[14/1/19, 10:47:13 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i feel dumb
[14/1/19, 10:47:16 PM] Yi Kai: Speaking of aq I'm completely unprepared for tomorrow
[14/1/19, 10:47:22 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: lol
[14/1/19, 10:47:24 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: idc alr
[14/1/19, 10:47:34 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: the points are impossible to prepare for
[14/1/19, 10:47:43 PM] Yi Kai: Lol
[16/1/19, 5:36:48 PM] Yi Kai: r-formula is actually amazing
[16/1/19, 5:37:01 PM] Yi Kai: It says formula but it isn't, it's just using the stuff we currently know
[16/1/19, 5:37:12 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: lol im only at E1 c
[16/1/19, 5:37:19 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: lmao
[16/1/19, 5:37:23 PM] Yi Kai: Lol
[16/1/19, 5:37:30 PM] Yi Kai: I'm at P1 liao even though I slack so long
[16/1/19, 5:37:37 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: why is r not -5
[16/1/19, 5:37:57 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: excuse me
[16/1/19, 5:37:58 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: !
[16/1/19, 5:38:12 PM] Yi Kai: Ok lah sorry lah
[16/1/19, 5:38:15 PM] Yi Kai: By convention
[16/1/19, 5:38:22 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: wth
[16/1/19, 5:38:40 PM] Yi Kai: Anyway I tried desmos-sing the graph if r is 5 or neg 5 (with the respective alphas) and both give the same graph
[16/1/19, 5:38:46 PM] Yi Kai: So it doesn't really matter honestly
[16/1/19, 5:38:57 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: but it affects theta
[16/1/19, 5:39:08 PM] Yi Kai: No
[16/1/19, 5:39:11 PM] Yi Kai: I thought it would too
[16/1/19, 5:39:24 PM] Yi Kai: By the way, I skipped the graph first
[16/1/19, 5:39:30 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: is it because alpha changes too
[16/1/19, 5:39:36 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oh
[16/1/19, 5:39:41 PM] Yi Kai: Yah
[16/1/19, 5:39:47 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oooo
[16/1/19, 5:40:21 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: isnt the graph easy
[16/1/19, 5:40:28 PM] Yi Kai: Yah
[16/1/19, 5:40:31 PM] Yi Kai: But I lazy
[16/1/19, 5:40:33 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: u just sketch 5cosx
[16/1/19, 5:40:39 PM] Yi Kai: 'Cause the curve I draw always not nice one
[16/1/19, 5:40:47 PM] Yi Kai: Need to translate to the right right?
[16/1/19, 5:40:57 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: damn annoying sia
[16/1/19, 5:41:02 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: 36.9 degrees
[16/1/19, 5:41:06 PM] Yi Kai: Yah
[16/1/19, 5:41:12 PM] Yi Kai: At first I copied from calculator as 39.6
[16/1/19, 5:41:17 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: lol
[16/1/19, 5:41:19 PM] Yi Kai: It's cause of the translation that I dao
[16/1/19, 5:41:31 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oh
[16/1/19, 6:13:40 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: how long is the working supposed to be
[16/1/19, 6:45:59 PM] Yi Kai: Quite long
[16/1/19, 6:46:08 PM] Yi Kai: If I split the space into 2 it's just nice
[16/1/19, 6:47:04 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oh phew
[16/1/19, 6:47:08 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i thought mine was too long
[16/1/19, 6:47:42 PM] Yi Kai: Same lol
[16/1/19, 6:47:50 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: my p1 was 1 column only though
[16/1/19, 6:47:51 PM] Yi Kai: And then they ask you do it again and again
[16/1/19, 6:47:58 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: maybe a bit more than 1
[16/1/19, 6:48:05 PM] Yi Kai: That one yah lah, eaiser 'cause no need find teta
[16/1/19, 6:48:18 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: huh
[16/1/19, 6:48:28 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: need what
[16/1/19, 6:48:45 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: check ans pls
[16/1/19, 6:48:51 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: e1 i got 75 and 345
[16/1/19, 6:48:57 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: e2*
[16/1/19, 6:49:15 PM] Yi Kai: Why you use degrees
[16/1/19, 6:49:18 PM] Yi Kai: Concept poor
[16/1/19, 6:49:27 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oops
[16/1/19, 6:49:31 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: but is it correct
[16/1/19, 6:49:55 PM] Yi Kai: 5pi/12 and 23pi/12
[16/1/19, 6:50:05 PM] Yi Kai: So I think it's correct
[16/1/19, 6:50:28 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: phew
[16/1/19, 6:50:34 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: wdym p1 dont need find theta
[16/1/19, 6:50:44 PM] Yi Kai: No need what, just find r and alpha
[16/1/19, 6:50:47 PM] Yi Kai: Part a then need
[16/1/19, 6:50:54 PM] Yi Kai: But part a don't need to find r and alpha
[16/1/19, 6:51:25 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: isnt theta x
[16/1/19, 6:51:34 PM] Yi Kai: Yes
[16/1/19, 6:51:44 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: then all need find theta what
[16/1/19, 6:51:44 PM] Yi Kai: Oh wait p1 not the same as e1
[16/1/19, 6:51:56 PM] Yi Kai: Nvm
[16/1/19, 6:52:04 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: lol
[16/1/19, 6:52:05 PM] Yi Kai: I still used to columns
[16/1/19, 6:52:07 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: p1 is
[16/1/19, 6:52:08 PM] Yi Kai: Which qn you at lol
[16/1/19, 6:52:16 PM] Yi Kai: I just went cycling and I'm at p2
[16/1/19, 6:52:18 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: 8.8 degrees?
[16/1/19, 6:52:22 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: p1
[16/1/19, 6:52:22 PM] Yi Kai: 2 columns*
[16/1/19, 6:52:26 PM] Yi Kai: One more
[16/1/19, 6:52:52 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: (360-73.9-56.3)÷2
[16/1/19, 6:53:01 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: 114.9
[16/1/19, 6:53:14 PM] Yi Kai: Yah that's the other one
[16/1/19, 6:53:20 PM] Yi Kai: Gd job

You did it!
[16/1/19, 6:53:21 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: im so good at this
[16/1/19, 6:53:22 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: jk
[16/1/19, 6:53:26 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: thanks!!
[16/1/19, 6:53:32 PM] Yi Kai: I like how we said like the same thing tgt
[16/1/19, 6:53:50 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: how u know the polarity of r cos (x alpha)
[16/1/19, 6:53:55 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: lmao
[16/1/19, 6:53:58 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i worked it out
[16/1/19, 6:54:04 PM] Yi Kai: You don't
[16/1/19, 6:54:09 PM] Yi Kai: Just make r positive
[16/1/19, 6:54:25 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: nani
[16/1/19, 6:54:27 PM] Yi Kai: Why would you need to though
[16/1/19, 6:54:41 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: but p1 is r cos (2x + 56.3°)
[16/1/19, 6:54:50 PM] Yi Kai: Yah
[16/1/19, 6:54:55 PM] Yi Kai: So polarity of what?
[16/1/19, 6:54:55 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: e2 is minus
[16/1/19, 6:54:58 PM] Yi Kai: Of alpha ah?
[16/1/19, 6:55:03 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ya
[16/1/19, 6:55:13 PM] Yi Kai: Just see if is cos + sin or cos - sin
[16/1/19, 6:55:29 PM] Yi Kai: If first one then alpha is negative. If second one then alpha is positive
[16/1/19, 6:55:36 PM] Yi Kai: Like if you think about it
[16/1/19, 6:55:46 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: all cases can derive until this ah
[16/1/19, 6:56:58 PM] Yi Kai: Yah
[16/1/19, 6:57:03 PM] Yi Kai: Think about how to expand the bracket
[16/1/19, 6:57:14 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ou ok
[16/1/19, 6:57:31 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: why is trigo like this
[16/1/19, 6:59:00 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: actually a lot of steps are redundant
[16/1/19, 6:59:07 PM] Yi Kai: Yes
[16/1/19, 6:59:09 PM] Yi Kai: They're just for show
[16/1/19, 6:59:20 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: u can find r by sqrt a^2 + b^2 for the first step
[16/1/19, 7:01:37 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: shouldnt polarity of alpha in p2 be minus
[16/1/19, 7:01:46 PM] Yi Kai: No
[16/1/19, 7:01:58 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oh its sin
[16/1/19, 7:02:01 PM] Yi Kai: 'Cause for sin if it's + it expands to +
[16/1/19, 7:02:12 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: math is amazing
[16/1/19, 7:02:21 PM] Yi Kai: Yes
[16/1/19, 7:02:26 PM] Yi Kai: I'm actually impressed by r-formula
[16/1/19, 7:02:31 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: LOL
[16/1/19, 7:19:33 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: did u get the same ans for e3
[16/1/19, 7:35:48 PM] Yi Kai: Supposed to lah
[16/1/19, 7:36:00 PM] Yi Kai: I figured it out Liao, plus you can use desmos to check one
[16/1/19, 8:02:58 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oh lol my first part was wrong not the second part
[16/1/19, 8:03:20 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: also i think u have to reject 23pi/12 for e2 because its not in range
[16/1/19, 8:25:21 PM] Yi Kai: It is
[16/1/19, 8:25:34 PM] Yi Kai: Less than 2pi
[16/1/19, 8:26:29 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: rhe range is 2pi - pi/6
[16/1/19, 8:26:43 PM] Yi Kai: Range is 0 to 2pi
[16/1/19, 8:27:14 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oh wait im looking at the wrong one
[16/1/19, 8:27:29 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: whats the answer for p2 and e3
[16/1/19, 8:30:01 PM] Yi Kai: 350.7, 144.0
[16/1/19, 8:30:09 PM] Yi Kai: Not done with e3, was preparing uniform
[16/1/19, 8:30:34 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i got this for e3
[16/1/19, 8:30:39 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: but p2 diff ans
[16/1/19, 8:30:40 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: wth
[16/1/19, 8:31:16 PM] Yi Kai: ...
[16/1/19, 8:31:29 PM] Yi Kai: I subbed them in, those 2 values are correct
‎[16/1/19, 8:31:47 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ‎image omitted
[16/1/19, 8:32:27 PM] Yi Kai: Why you skip so many steps...
[16/1/19, 8:32:34 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: lmao
[16/1/19, 8:32:35 PM] Yi Kai: Your cos value and sin value are flipped
[16/1/19, 8:32:39 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: lmao^
[16/1/19, 8:32:46 PM] Yi Kai: Like cos is 12/r,  sin is 5/r
[16/1/19, 8:32:56 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: OMG
[16/1/19, 8:33:22 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: how did i get e3 correct though
[16/1/19, 8:33:22 PM] Yi Kai: This is why I commented on the no. of steps you skippe
[16/1/19, 8:34:04 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: f
[16/1/19, 9:09:13 PM] Yi Kai: I tried playing survivio but my com lag too badly
[16/1/19, 9:09:29 PM] Yi Kai: I don't know why but I feel like my com became cui today
[16/1/19, 9:17:39 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: lol
[16/1/19, 9:17:41 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: how old is it
[16/1/19, 9:18:05 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: also is P4 u just convert to the r formula form
[16/1/19, 9:41:51 PM] Yi Kai: From sec 1
[16/1/19, 9:42:06 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: quite old
[16/1/19, 9:42:09 PM] Yi Kai: I don't think so
[16/1/19, 9:42:16 PM] Yi Kai: Warranty not over yet leh
[16/1/19, 9:42:26 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: huh wth
[16/1/19, 9:42:29 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: 5 year ah
[16/1/19, 9:42:35 PM] Yi Kai: Apple care
[16/1/19, 9:42:43 PM] Yi Kai: 3 years
[16/1/19, 9:42:47 PM] Yi Kai: Need to buy one
[16/1/19, 9:42:56 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oh
[16/1/19, 9:43:06 PM] Yi Kai: But they don't let you buy more than 5 years
[16/1/19, 9:43:25 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oh
[16/1/19, 9:43:33 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: cant believe im still doing math
[16/1/19, 9:43:33 PM] Yi Kai: Like many coms after 1-2 years not v good liao
[16/1/19, 9:43:37 PM] Yi Kai: Bruh
[16/1/19, 9:43:42 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: this is why everyday is unproductive
[16/1/19, 9:43:43 PM] Yi Kai: I finished like 30 minutes ago
[16/1/19, 9:43:53 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i spend the longest time on math
[16/1/19, 9:43:57 PM] Yi Kai: Did you do anything other than math?
[16/1/19, 9:44:01 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: no
[16/1/19, 9:44:09 PM] Yi Kai: Same, my mum's like why do I see you doing math all the time
[16/1/19, 9:44:16 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: lol
[16/1/19, 9:49:32 PM] Yi Kai: Youtube videos about physics stuff is actually fun to watch siah

[16/1/19, 10:11:39 PM] Yi Kai: Just dao and sleep
[16/1/19, 10:11:51 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: but i feel damn unproductive
[16/1/19, 10:11:58 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: cus i gave up on math
[17/1/19, 6:23:59 AM] Yi Kai: Lol same
[17/1/19, 2:20:08 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: lol
[17/1/19, 2:20:14 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: theres a mynah in mcdonalds
[17/1/19, 2:43:34 PM] Yi Kai: What’s that?
[17/1/19, 2:49:19 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: the black bird with yellow beak

[17/1/19, 9:18:16 PM] Yi Kai: I just won't fool around too much
[17/1/19, 9:18:31 PM] Yi Kai: I'll just treat him like any NCO, don't revise but treat it seriously
[17/1/19, 9:18:44 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: mm
[17/1/19, 9:18:58 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: are u planning on trying to pass 1 st class
[17/1/19, 9:19:05 PM] Yi Kai: I will try lah
[17/1/19, 9:19:08 PM] Yi Kai: But not too hard

[18/1/19, 9:24:15 PM] Yi Kai: Instagram.com/realpiggysmallz
[18/1/19, 9:24:17 PM] Yi Kai: I follow it
[18/1/19, 9:31:18 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: lol
[19/1/19, 12:19:03 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: 3sinx + 4cosx = 0
(cosx)3tanx + 4 = 0
[19/1/19, 12:19:08 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: can it work like this
[19/1/19, 12:19:52 PM] Yi Kai: I am nowhere near starting assignment, I intend to do 电邮 then SS then I'll decide between assignment and reflections
[19/1/19, 12:20:02 PM] Yi Kai: You mean cosx(3tanx + 4)
[19/1/19, 12:20:12 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: yeah
[19/1/19, 12:20:19 PM] Yi Kai: On second line on LHS
[19/1/19, 12:20:21 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ss is just copying stuff
[19/1/19, 12:20:28 PM] Yi Kai: Then yes, it works
[19/1/19, 12:20:29 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ya
[19/1/19, 12:20:40 PM] Yi Kai: But why you want to do that
[19/1/19, 12:20:56 PM] Yi Kai: 3sinx = -4cosx
tanx=-4/3
[19/1/19, 12:20:55 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: is it one of the possible solutions of x
[19/1/19, 12:20:58 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: the cosx = 0
[19/1/19, 12:21:23 PM] Yi Kai: If cos x = 0, then sin x = 0 right?
[19/1/19, 12:21:28 PM] Yi Kai: But such things don't exist
[19/1/19, 12:21:44 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: huh
[19/1/19, 12:21:54 PM] Yi Kai: Then x = 90, but then tangent is undefined?
[19/1/19, 12:22:12 PM] Yi Kai: As in no solution for cos x = sin x = 0
[19/1/19, 12:22:19 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: so when its =0 just simplify it ah
[19/1/19, 12:22:21 PM] Yi Kai: 'Cause if you manipulate it then yah
[19/1/19, 12:22:24 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: dont need fsctorise
[19/1/19, 12:22:26 PM] Yi Kai: Yah lah
[19/1/19, 12:22:34 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: what if its =1
[19/1/19, 12:22:36 PM] Yi Kai: You want to do r formula also can, but a bit retarded
[19/1/19, 12:22:41 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: lol
[19/1/19, 12:48:29 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: when we squareroot in pythagoras do we take into account the negative solution too
[19/1/19, 12:48:44 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: b = sqrt 2^2 - 1^2
[19/1/19, 12:49:15 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: technically not in normal triangles but what about the triangle in astc
[19/1/19, 12:55:16 PM] Yi Kai: Depends
[19/1/19, 12:55:44 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: so if its not possible for it to be negative then we just ignore the negative case ah
[19/1/19, 12:55:48 PM] Yi Kai: Yah
[19/1/19, 12:55:55 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ok thanks

[19/1/19, 8:11:44 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: no why
[19/1/19, 8:11:59 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: true

[20/1/19, 7:12:21 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: or is it the other way
[20/1/19, 7:12:26 PM] Yi Kai: If it’s not coloured black then minus mark
[20/1/19, 7:12:41 PM] Yi Kai: For each criteria fulfilled you minus one mark
[20/1/19, 7:13:07 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: lol wth

[22/1/19, 10:40:33 PM] Yi Kai: 1 mol of e- produces 0.5 mol of h2 gas
[22/1/19, 10:40:44 PM] Yi Kai: 0.5 mol of gas is around 12dm^3
[22/1/19, 10:40:46 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: 0.5 mol legit works ah
[22/1/19, 10:40:52 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i thought it was a scam
[22/1/19, 10:41:35 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: also i thought u were asleep
[22/1/19, 10:41:58 PM] Yi Kai: 1 mol is the weird constant, not 1 molecule anyway

[31/1/19, 9:30:00 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: u meeting him when
[31/1/19, 9:30:41 PM] Yi Kai: I would use subtraction.

Like find the number of ways in total, then find number of ways if the 2 men will be tgt, then take the first one minus the second one
[31/1/19, 9:30:56 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i did that but idk if its correct
[31/1/19, 9:30:57 PM] Yi Kai: Tomorrow night, 'cause we both stay at sembawang, so he pass me at the MRT lorh

[31/1/19, 9:31:31 PM] Yi Kai: Why 6?
[31/1/19, 9:32:04 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: if they serve together then that leaves 1 spot for 6 other people
[31/1/19, 9:32:19 PM] Yi Kai: Need to multiply with the women part, 'cause each cases for the man can be many cases if you change the women
[31/1/19, 9:32:48 PM] Yi Kai: It's like 6 * 6 choose 2
[31/1/19, 9:32:57 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oh

[2/2/19, 10:54:50 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: c*
[2/2/19, 10:55:11 PM] Yi Kai: What you mean 4 or 6?
[2/2/19, 10:55:21 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: basically the worksheet just states that arrangement is circle is the same just that u need to minus 1
[2/2/19, 10:55:22 PM] Yi Kai: Accidental call sorry
[2/2/19, 10:55:27 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ignore that part
[2/2/19, 10:55:50 PM] Yi Kai: Then?
[2/2/19, 10:55:58 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: minus 1 as in
[2/2/19, 10:56:03 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: if got 6 to be arranged
[2/2/19, 10:56:11 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: its (6-1)!
[2/2/19, 10:56:23 PM] Yi Kai: Just like find the number of ways you can choose 4 people then divide by 4 lorh
[2/2/19, 10:56:27 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: but idk how to do c) because theres 5 people for 4 positions
[2/2/19, 10:56:39 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: why
[2/2/19, 10:56:51 PM] Yi Kai: Cause every 4 people you can rotate in 4 ways
[2/2/19, 10:57:04 PM] Yi Kai: What’s why you have that example, cause it’ll just be divide by 6
[2/2/19, 10:57:28 PM] Yi Kai: Makes sense?
[2/2/19, 10:57:31 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oh
[2/2/19, 10:57:33 PM] Yi Kai: I need to stop slacking siah
[2/2/19, 10:57:46 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: so its 4C3 ÷ 4
[2/2/19, 10:57:56 PM] Yi Kai: Why 4C3
[2/2/19, 10:58:02 PM] Yi Kai: Times 2 though
[2/2/19, 10:58:10 PM] Yi Kai: Cause you can pick any one from the twins
[2/2/19, 10:58:11 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: cause one of the twin must be there
[2/2/19, 10:58:16 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oh ya
[2/2/19, 10:58:28 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: 2 possible ways
[2/2/19, 10:58:34 PM] Yi Kai: d is a different story by the way
[2/2/19, 10:58:39 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: lol what hw do u have left
[2/2/19, 10:58:41 PM] Yi Kai: You assume the twins to be one
[2/2/19, 10:58:50 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: yeah
[2/2/19, 10:59:02 PM] Yi Kai: Chinese chem, dao SS, and English essay (which I can’t make myself do)
[2/2/19, 10:59:07 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: (5-1)!×2! i think
[2/2/19, 10:59:16 PM] Yi Kai: I haven’t done anything much these few days
[2/2/19, 10:59:18 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: wait no
[2/2/19, 10:59:23 PM] Yi Kai: Don’t think of it as -1 lah
[2/2/19, 10:59:37 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: 4C2×2! or something
[2/2/19, 10:59:46 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: thats what maumu wrote in the ws
[2/2/19, 10:59:54 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: but ya
[2/2/19, 11:00:13 PM] Yi Kai: Part d should he 4C2 divide 3 plus 1
[2/2/19, 11:00:26 PM] Yi Kai: 4C2 divide 3 is when both the twins are there
[2/2/19, 11:00:34 PM] Yi Kai: But that one need to x2 sorry
[2/2/19, 11:00:49 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: why plus 1
[2/2/19, 11:00:55 PM] Yi Kai: Actually shouldn’t be +1, cause have more when both twins are out
[2/2/19, 11:01:01 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: huh
[2/2/19, 11:01:09 PM] Yi Kai: Cause if don’t need care about order then only 1 way
[2/2/19, 11:01:16 PM] Yi Kai: If both of the twins not there then yah
[2/2/19, 11:01:40 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: omg need to consider when they are not in the group
[2/2/19, 11:01:46 PM] Yi Kai: Lol yah
[2/2/19, 11:02:00 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: the english for permutation and combination questions is so confusing

[10/2/19, 9:15:47 AM] Yi Kai: Maybe can, but then may count extra when one divisor same place then the divisor yo he removed is changed
[10/2/19, 9:16:08 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: then the 2nd one is when there is 1 empty space
[10/2/19, 9:16:31 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: so theres 1 divisor
[10/2/19, 9:17:00 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: but since the buckets are distinguishable i multiplied by 3 factorial
[10/2/19, 11:14:08 AM] Yi Kai: The heck
[10/2/19, 11:14:23 AM] Yi Kai: But then that 1 divisor already accounts for the multiple orders?
[10/2/19, 11:14:34 AM] Yi Kai: Then what if there are 2 empty buckets
[10/2/19, 11:15:02 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: lmao idk
[10/2/19, 11:15:19 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: then its just 8 balls in 1 bucket what
[10/2/19, 11:15:35 AM] Yi Kai: Yah that one you can have 3 ways not 3!
[10/2/19, 11:16:12 AM] Yi Kai: If you don’t put the 3! There you get same as me Liao
[10/2/19, 11:25:52 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: the 3! is for 1 empty bucket
[10/2/19, 11:35:25 AM] Yi Kai: But then if you do it by the divisor way then all orders are accounted for Liao
[10/2/19, 12:04:53 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: wait really ah
[10/2/19, 12:05:03 PM] Yi Kai: Yes...
[10/2/19, 12:05:33 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: but then i get 45 though
[10/2/19, 12:20:20 PM] Yi Kai: Correct Liao lorh
[10/2/19, 12:22:51 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oh

[16/2/19, 7:24:30 AM] Yi Kai: If 6 electrons pass through the circuit, the number of mol of atom electrolysed will be 6:3:2
If you multiply each by the relative atomic mass (3:2:1) you get 18:6:2 which becomes 9:3:1
[16/2/19, 8:46:42 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ohh
[16/2/19, 8:46:45 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: thanks
[16/2/19, 10:39:54 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: yong kong
[16/2/19, 11:24:24 PM] Yi Kai: ?
[16/2/19, 11:24:45 PM] Yi Kai: Oh nvm
[19/2/19, 8:55:27 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: what did u get for s6 math
[19/2/19, 8:55:48 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: its like so simple idk if im missing anything
[19/2/19, 8:58:26 PM] Yi Kai: 1/2
[19/2/19, 8:58:29 PM] Yi Kai: It's quite no shit
[19/2/19, 8:58:33 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: LOL
[19/2/19, 8:58:38 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: simi sai
[19/2/19, 8:58:51 PM] Yi Kai: S5 is 80% I think, if not it's that there's not enough info
[19/2/19, 8:59:03 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i havent done s5
[19/2/19, 8:59:13 PM] Yi Kai: I actually already have all the articles I will use for the news thing this week
[19/2/19, 8:59:20 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: lol
[19/2/19, 8:59:23 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: is it all the budget
[19/2/19, 8:59:26 PM] Yi Kai: I guess I'll use them to try being productive tomorrow
[19/2/19, 8:59:29 PM] Yi Kai: No
[19/2/19, 8:59:38 PM] Yi Kai: I just do one budget then everything else try to find different stuff
[19/2/19, 8:59:43 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oh
[19/2/19, 8:59:55 PM] Yi Kai: But for zaobao I lazy search up ('cause very hard to read title by title) so I just anyhow pick a budget one
[19/2/19, 9:00:07 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i cant read chinese sia
[19/2/19, 9:00:15 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: like i cant process the words in zaobao
[19/2/19, 9:00:19 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: the titles
[19/2/19, 9:00:26 PM] Yi Kai: Like one on budget summary, one on SIA in-flight system they assure customers the camera not used
[19/2/19, 9:00:32 PM] Yi Kai: Same, then no picture one
[19/2/19, 9:00:51 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: also i forgot to do a chinese article last week
[19/2/19, 9:00:52 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oops
[19/2/19, 9:01:04 PM] Yi Kai: Then chinese I do one more budget on different parts, plus "streaming students has pitfalls as well as benefits"  (said by ong ye kung)
[19/2/19, 9:01:09 PM] Yi Kai: Lol did Ng even notice
[19/2/19, 9:01:16 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i didnt hand in
[19/2/19, 9:01:23 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oh lol
[19/2/19, 9:01:33 PM] Yi Kai: Ok lol
[19/2/19, 9:01:35 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: aiya i tmr then see which one to do
[19/2/19, 9:01:39 PM] Yi Kai: Lol ok
[19/2/19, 9:01:50 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: its the only hw you can do during reading period
[19/2/19, 9:01:52 PM] Yi Kai: Like when I sien just do this kind of hw very easy one
[19/2/19, 9:01:54 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: so make us of it
[19/2/19, 9:01:58 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: use
[19/2/19, 9:02:09 PM] Yi Kai: I just browse through articles during reading period to find good stuff to write about
[19/2/19, 9:02:23 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: most of the articles nth to write one
[19/2/19, 9:05:49 PM] Yi Kai: Lol that's why I spend the whole time just browsing articles
[19/2/19, 10:12:03 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oh
[21/2/19, 3:04:51 PM] Yi Kai: Last time after playing atomas the fingerprints left are in a circle.

Now after playing chess for 20 minutes like that I see a grid of fingerprints on my phone

[22/2/19, 6:27:21 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: what u meann
[22/2/19, 6:40:45 AM] Yi Kai: Cause start at 7.30 means teacher walk in at 7.15

[22/2/19, 6:45:30 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: nvm
[23/2/19, 10:45:44 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: what the i didnt do the compre what corrections does wdk want
[23/2/19, 10:53:48 AM] Yi Kai: I don’t know
[23/2/19, 10:53:52 AM] Yi Kai: Same siah
[23/2/19, 10:53:58 AM] Yi Kai: Then the 活动本
[23/2/19, 10:54:17 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: wlao
[23/2/19, 10:54:24 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: can i not hand in

[23/2/19, 10:54:28 AM] Yi Kai: Same siah
[23/2/19, 10:54:31 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i rather do math
[23/2/19, 10:54:33 AM] Yi Kai: I haven’t done any homework
[23/2/19, 10:54:39 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i did like 1 physics ws
[23/2/19, 10:54:41 AM] Yi Kai: I’m still worrying about NOI selection 1-6pm
[23/2/19, 10:54:48 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: nah
[23/2/19, 10:54:49 AM] Yi Kai: I left the chem and both physics
[23/2/19, 10:54:52 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i thought u v zai one
[23/2/19, 10:54:58 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: the chem quite easy
[23/2/19, 10:55:06 AM] Yi Kai: Yah
[23/2/19, 10:55:11 AM] Yi Kai: Yah lah
[23/2/19, 10:55:19 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: LOL
[23/2/19, 10:55:26 AM] Yi Kai: But i always scared I screw up and get 0 like in sec 2
[23/2/19, 10:55:33 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: wth
[23/2/19, 10:55:35 AM] Yi Kai: Cause if you get 0 then no chance Liao
[23/2/19, 10:55:35 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: how u get 0
[23/2/19, 10:55:48 AM] Yi Kai: Can’t do any problem lorh
[23/2/19, 10:55:58 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: huh
[23/2/19, 10:56:19 AM] Yi Kai: Basically if all the stuff you code somehow cannot work
[23/2/19, 10:56:23 AM] Yi Kai: Then you don’t get marks
[23/2/19, 10:56:26 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oh
[23/2/19, 10:56:28 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: good luck!

[23/2/19, 10:56:55 AM] Yi Kai: Second time going RI today ever lol
[23/2/19, 10:56:59 AM] Yi Kai: First time was open house
[23/2/19, 10:57:17 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i havent been there
[23/2/19, 10:57:19 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ooo
[24/2/19, 7:00:21 PM] Yi Kai: Eh did you do 活动本
[24/2/19, 7:00:35 PM] Yi Kai: I scared I become the only one who didn’t do
[24/2/19, 7:00:51 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i didnt do both huodngben and compre
[24/2/19, 7:01:26 PM] Yi Kai: Ok same
[24/2/19, 7:01:35 PM] Yi Kai: Cause zhiheng was telling me how he spent 2 hours on it
[24/2/19, 7:34:35 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: lol
[24/2/19, 7:34:49 PM] Yi Kai: You know the resistance thing
[24/2/19, 7:35:04 PM] Yi Kai: Like they say resistance proportional to this this this over that that that right
[24/2/19, 7:35:06 PM] Yi Kai: What’s it ah
[24/2/19, 7:35:36 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: R = pL / A?
[24/2/19, 7:35:41 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: p is resistivity
[24/2/19, 7:35:44 PM] Yi Kai: L is length
[24/2/19, 7:35:51 PM] Yi Kai: A is cross sectional area?
[24/2/19, 7:35:55 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ya
[24/2/19, 7:35:58 PM] Yi Kai: Then temperature separately count?
[24/2/19, 7:36:06 PM] Yi Kai: Higher temp higher resistivity right
[24/2/19, 7:36:20 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ya
[24/2/19, 7:36:22 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: why ah
[24/2/19, 7:36:44 PM] Yi Kai: Something like particles move faster
[24/2/19, 7:36:55 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: then why harder to move
[24/2/19, 7:37:32 PM] Yi Kai: I don’t know
[24/2/19, 7:37:38 PM] Yi Kai: The diagram kind of explained it
[24/2/19, 7:54:41 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: wait what is converted into heat energy
[24/2/19, 7:54:47 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: when a circuit is set up
[24/2/19, 7:55:32 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: voltage affects how much energy is transferred to heat energy
[24/2/19, 8:29:00 PM] Yi Kai: The resistor causes energy to be converted to *thermal* energy lorh

More current/voltage then more energy input then more thermal energy output lorh
[24/2/19, 8:29:15 PM] Yi Kai: You daoing right
[24/2/19, 8:49:16 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: probably

[24/2/19, 9:07:13 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: huh
[24/2/19, 9:07:22 PM] Yi Kai: For the 词语 part it's mostly useless 'cause it's just searching the dictionary then might as well copy the answers
[24/2/19, 9:07:33 PM] Yi Kai: 活动本 has comprehension exercises
[24/2/19, 9:07:47 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ik

[7/3/19, 9:26:29 PM] Yi Kai: Then I realise I waste so much free time when I started playing chess, 'cause if I use the time I play chess to mug, I can easily mug 1-2 hours a day and that's very good to me
[7/3/19, 9:28:59 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: but there is a neverending list of things to do
[7/3/19, 9:29:17 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: like even if u complete your homework for the day
[7/3/19, 9:30:02 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i mean like if i spend all my time mugging i would probably go crazy

[7/3/19, 9:31:06 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: its very fast if u copy
[7/3/19, 9:31:24 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: compared to if u dont copy u have to spend all your time finding the ciyu and stuff
[7/3/19, 9:31:31 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: especially since he hasnt taught us yet

[16/3/19, 11:26:49 AM] Yi Kai: And good move when you use knight to Attack queen and king at the same time, but need to look out if moving there puts that piece under Attack

[16/3/19, 11:29:42 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i always do some retarded thing that makes me lose pieces for nothing
[16/3/19, 11:30:36 AM] Yi Kai: If you playing without time pressure you can set it to confirm your moves
[16/3/19, 11:30:57 AM] Yi Kai: Like after you make the move it’ll show it on your screen then ask you to confirm before sending it over

[16/3/19, 12:11:17 PM] Yi Kai: That one doesn't matter, "the cadets" sounds more correct than "cadets" 'cause it's the specific 5 people

[16/3/19, 8:20:15 PM] Yi Kai: Check out this #chess game: lunafrank vs 790lbe - https://www.chess.com/live/game/3536755046

Basically the checkmate though

Cause the guy resign knowing he loses after moving his rook back down
[16/3/19, 8:22:50 PM] Yi Kai: Omg you legit played damn well
[16/3/19, 8:24:01 PM] Yi Kai: Oh yah and you can do this analysis thing on the app it tells how you could have played better
[16/3/19, 8:31:58 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: whats the difference between the 1 min and 5 min analysis though
[16/3/19, 8:32:47 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: waw
[16/3/19, 8:32:49 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: those trades
[16/3/19, 8:36:29 PM] Yi Kai: 5 min one need to pay
[16/3/19, 8:36:36 PM] Yi Kai: Lol

[16/3/19, 8:36:48 PM] Yi Kai: Also need pay
[16/3/19, 8:36:54 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: eee scam
[16/3/19, 8:36:55 PM] Yi Kai: Basically it’s about how in-depth
[16/3/19, 8:37:06 PM] Yi Kai: If you want do puzzle rush need the web page one
[16/3/19, 8:37:14 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oh
[16/3/19, 8:37:30 PM] Yi Kai: But it’s damn fun
[16/3/19, 8:37:51 PM] Yi Kai: For puzzle rush it’s ok to spend more time and solve rather than rush through and get wrong
[16/3/19, 8:38:41 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: why
[16/3/19, 8:39:03 PM] Yi Kai: Cause once you get 3 wrong you lose regardless of how much time you have left
[16/3/19, 8:39:21 PM] Yi Kai: And the puzzles get harder over time so it’s normal to not solve
[16/3/19, 8:55:26 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oh
[16/3/19, 8:55:35 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: do u get anyth from solving everything
[16/3/19, 8:55:47 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: also i forgot my laptop password so i can only unlock it with my fingerprint now
[16/3/19, 8:55:49 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: f
[16/3/19, 8:57:58 PM] Yi Kai: Learning and the experience if you ask me
[16/3/19, 9:00:26 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: lol
[16/3/19, 9:00:31 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: what if i ask bernard
[16/3/19, 9:10:43 PM] Yi Kai: He damn cui at those
[16/3/19, 9:15:50 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: lmao
‎[16/3/19, 10:29:13 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ‎image omitted
[16/3/19, 10:45:25 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: also the 3 min game is kinda stupid u just have to waste their time without urself dying
[16/3/19, 10:46:14 PM] Yi Kai: Well 5 and 10 min more legit to me
[16/3/19, 10:46:38 PM] Yi Kai: Missed win means that you could have gotten a checkmate
[16/3/19, 10:47:47 PM] Yi Kai: Usually things like mate in X means that if you play correctly, you can checkmate your opponent within X moves. If you missed win, that means that you played wrongly then become cannot checkmate
[16/3/19, 10:48:22 PM] Yi Kai: By the way, stalemate means one person has no possible moves on his turn. So sometimes I try to use this to make it a draw when opponent is clearly winning
[16/3/19, 10:49:24 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: huh that means if all my moves are correct i win
[16/3/19, 10:49:33 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: lol
[16/3/19, 10:49:35 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: how do u do that
[16/3/19, 10:53:26 PM] Yi Kai: Yah, like ideal
[16/3/19, 10:54:00 PM] Yi Kai: Like all his pawns are blocked then like the king has no valid squares to go
[16/3/19, 10:58:06 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: his king?
[16/3/19, 11:20:54 PM] Yi Kai: Oh you mean how you could have checkmated ah
[16/3/19, 11:22:38 PM] Yi Kai: I don’t know I think it’s supposed to mean he could have checkmated you
[16/3/19, 11:22:41 PM] Yi Kai: But I don’t see it
[16/3/19, 11:23:08 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: like do u force him to have no more moves
[16/3/19, 11:23:22 PM] Yi Kai: Kind of
[16/3/19, 11:23:27 PM] Yi Kai: Like no valid moves
[16/3/19, 11:23:40 PM] Yi Kai: But if you’re winning be careful not to do that because it results in a draw
[16/3/19, 11:24:25 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: lol i always do that in the lessons thing
[16/3/19, 11:25:09 PM] Yi Kai: Lol
[16/3/19, 11:25:37 PM] Yi Kai: No more moves means can’t even make stupid moves
[16/3/19, 11:25:53 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: yah
[16/3/19, 11:26:03 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: whenever i try to win i accidentally trap the king
[16/3/19, 11:33:36 PM] Yi Kai: Check out this #chess game: mkarmoy vs lunafrank - https://www.chess.com/live/game/3539425914

Moral of the story: beware of checkmates
[16/3/19, 11:35:04 PM] Yi Kai: I was clearly losing lol
[16/3/19, 11:40:23 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oops

[17/3/19, 11:11:23 AM] Yi Kai: There was 1-2 where my opponent was one move from checkmating me then I won on time
[17/3/19, 11:15:24 AM] Yi Kai: Go and search for double rook checkmate
[17/3/19, 11:56:31 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oo
[17/3/19, 11:56:36 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: u force the king to the wall

[17/3/19, 7:18:00 PM] Yi Kai: If he takes your queen it’s a stalemate
[17/3/19, 7:46:01 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: wts
[17/3/19, 7:50:09 PM] Yi Kai: Then if he doesn’t you can take his queen then you become on the winning side
[17/3/19, 7:50:22 PM] Yi Kai: Basically it helps you prevent losing which is some next level play

[21/3/19, 12:37:04 PM] Yi Kai: As in December
[21/3/19, 12:39:33 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oh
[21/3/19, 12:39:35 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: siao
[21/3/19, 1:38:21 PM] Yi Kai: Cause people usually start being trainer at around sec 4
[21/3/19, 1:49:53 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: don't u learn also
[21/3/19, 1:50:07 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: u finished the syllabus alr meh
[21/3/19, 2:01:43 PM] Yi Kai: NOI syllabus not that much
[21/3/19, 2:01:51 PM] Yi Kai: It's about how you tweak the algo and stuff
[21/3/19, 2:02:00 PM] Yi Kai: 'Cause a lot of questions don't use standard algorithm
[21/3/19, 2:02:33 PM] Yi Kai: The syllabus basically teaches you the common algo, then the rest must 灵活 think on the spot
[21/3/19, 2:45:52 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oh
[21/3/19, 4:29:17 PM] Yi Kai: Should I go CD
[21/3/19, 4:29:18 PM] Yi Kai: I lazy

[22/3/19, 8:03:18 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: 2 english aq
[22/3/19, 8:03:21 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: physics project
[22/3/19, 8:03:35 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: and like chem olympiad stuff
[22/3/19, 8:04:19 AM] Yi Kai: Oh you finished Chinese meh?
[22/3/19, 8:04:24 AM] Yi Kai: Didn’t see your upload for oral
[22/3/19, 8:04:34 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: im not doing it probably
[22/3/19, 8:04:36 AM] Yi Kai: That one need to just get it over and done with one
[22/3/19, 8:04:36 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: lazy
[22/3/19, 8:04:45 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: v lazy also
[22/3/19, 8:04:45 AM] Yi Kai: I feel bad
[22/3/19, 8:04:51 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: why
[22/3/19, 8:05:00 AM] Yi Kai: Plus now I have 3 chapters for 活动本
[22/3/19, 8:05:11 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: wait u didnt do at all
[22/3/19, 8:05:14 AM] Yi Kai: Cause he keep saying as if you’ll definitely do like that
[22/3/19, 8:05:20 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: huh when
[22/3/19, 8:05:21 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: wtf
[22/3/19, 8:05:25 AM] Yi Kai: Less than 2 pages
[22/3/19, 8:05:31 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: LOL
[22/3/19, 8:05:32 AM] Yi Kai: 活动本
[22/3/19, 8:06:01 AM] Yi Kai: Let Zhiheng said, copying is a waste of money

I say, it’s a waste of time, especially the non 词语 parts
[22/3/19, 8:06:17 AM] Yi Kai: That one we meeting up after I’m done with exco meeting
[22/3/19, 8:06:25 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: not doing is a waste of money
[22/3/19, 8:06:28 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: lol same
[22/3/19, 8:06:31 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ur group is whi
[22/3/19, 8:06:32 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: who
[22/3/19, 8:06:43 AM] Yi Kai: True

[22/3/19, 8:06:50 AM] Yi Kai: You?
[22/3/19, 8:07:09 AM] Yi Kai: At first I wanted to make them get a random date then say I not free the 2 of them can do
[22/3/19, 8:07:13 AM] Yi Kai: But it failed
[22/3/19, 8:07:24 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: shaojun shuhuai
[22/3/19, 8:07:31 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: LOL
[22/3/19, 8:07:47 AM] Yi Kai: Oh still ok lah
[22/3/19, 8:08:03 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: deception
[22/3/19, 8:08:12 AM] Yi Kai: Also, since I don’t want go wangdk remedial, my parents want me to finish his papers
[22/3/19, 8:08:28 AM] Yi Kai: Why
[22/3/19, 8:08:49 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: going his remedial probably takes less time
[22/3/19, 8:08:51 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: unless ure expected to finish the papers and then attend remedial
[22/3/19, 8:09:04 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: trying to pon that thing
[22/3/19, 8:09:06 AM] Yi Kai: I transport 2 hour each time leh
[22/3/19, 8:09:28 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: hmm
[22/3/19, 8:09:39 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ok nvm
[22/3/19, 8:09:44 AM] Yi Kai: Plus after I come back from remedial I’ll tend to slack another 0.5-1 hour
[22/3/19, 8:10:01 AM] Yi Kai: So even if I slack through doing paper probably save time
[22/3/19, 8:10:09 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: mm
[22/3/19, 8:10:19 AM] Yi Kai: Gucci tennis shoes, running from your issues

[27/3/19, 7:13:59 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: theres a mall
[27/3/19, 7:14:05 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: lol
[27/3/19, 7:14:05 PM] Yi Kai: it's the only part I use mousepad
[27/3/19, 7:14:09 PM] Yi Kai: Don't think so
[27/3/19, 7:14:15 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: huh
[27/3/19, 7:14:16 PM] Yi Kai: Nvm just remembered CCA lethim pon
[27/3/19, 7:14:21 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i went there before
[27/3/19, 7:14:27 PM] Yi Kai: Wait nvm I thought you say I think there's a mall
[27/3/19, 7:14:40 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oh lol
[27/3/19, 7:14:46 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: kallang wave mall or smth

[27/3/19, 7:16:01 PM] Yi Kai: Yes
[27/3/19, 7:16:13 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: 🙅
[27/3/19, 7:16:34 PM] Yi Kai: ?
[27/3/19, 7:16:44 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: illegal activities
[27/3/19, 7:17:14 PM] Yi Kai: Who cares tbh
[27/3/19, 7:17:19 PM] Yi Kai: I did it so many times in class liao
[27/3/19, 7:17:28 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: class no one cares
[27/3/19, 7:17:34 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: huiyan openly eats
[27/3/19, 7:17:36 PM] Yi Kai: Esp if huiyan gets caught I'll purposely get his attention before eating to bm
[27/3/19, 7:17:45 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: lol
[27/3/19, 9:58:09 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: is the gradient function of f(x) = 3 3 or 0
[27/3/19, 10:00:37 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i checked my answers against photomath and its correct but i used f'(x) = 3 but when i enter d/dx (3) into photomath it gives me 0
[27/3/19, 10:09:47 PM] Yi Kai: 0
[27/3/19, 10:10:02 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: why 0
[27/3/19, 10:10:17 PM] Yi Kai: f(x)=0 gives a horizontal line right
[27/3/19, 10:10:22 PM] Yi Kai: So the gradient always 0
‎[27/3/19, 10:10:26 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ‎image omitted
[27/3/19, 10:10:33 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: is this a diff thing
[27/3/19, 10:10:38 PM] Yi Kai: Limit not differentiation
‎[27/3/19, 10:11:08 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ‎image omitted
[27/3/19, 10:11:11 PM] Yi Kai: f'(x)=f(x+ dx)-f(x)/dx = 3-3/dx=0
[27/3/19, 10:11:13 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: 2x-1 is correct according to photomath
[27/3/19, 10:11:19 PM] Yi Kai: Correct
[27/3/19, 10:11:27 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: whattt
[27/3/19, 10:11:54 PM] Yi Kai: Limit not the same as differentiation. If you use other ways to differentiate then it's different
[27/3/19, 10:12:16 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: u mean the way im doing it isnt differentiation
[27/3/19, 10:13:09 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: cus this one i just split into 2 different functions and then find the limit for both
[27/3/19, 10:13:22 PM] Yi Kai: It is, but there are multiple ways to do it
[27/3/19, 10:13:44 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: but shouldnt it all agree to the same conclusion
[27/3/19, 10:13:44 PM] Yi Kai: I mean like to me and Yiqin who did it at physics olympiad before, then it's very simple
[27/3/19, 10:13:57 PM] Yi Kai: Yes, which it does
[27/3/19, 10:13:58 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: that d/dx (3) = 3 or 0
[27/3/19, 10:14:05 PM] Yi Kai: 0
[27/3/19, 10:14:11 PM] Yi Kai: ^
[27/3/19, 10:14:24 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: but in my answer there i wrote d/dx (1) as 1
[27/3/19, 10:14:37 PM] Yi Kai: Show me the working
[27/3/19, 10:14:43 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: unless lim 1 isnt same as d/dx 1
[27/3/19, 10:14:52 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: the underlined part
[27/3/19, 10:15:55 PM] Yi Kai: It's not
[27/3/19, 10:16:12 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: wait why
[27/3/19, 10:16:50 PM] Yi Kai: Dude the second part differentiates the -x, which should give -1 as the gradient, nothing wrong
[27/3/19, 10:17:44 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: but doesnt d/dx 1 mean that lim is 1
[27/3/19, 10:18:57 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: yah ik
[27/3/19, 10:19:51 PM] Yi Kai: d/dx of 1 is lim as d tends to 0, (1-1)/d = 0
[27/3/19, 10:20:44 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: wait theres a value for d
[27/3/19, 10:21:46 PM] Yi Kai: As in like the delta x lah
[27/3/19, 10:27:06 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: is it because when i write d/dx 1, it means gradient and when i write lim 1 it just means that specific point
[27/3/19, 10:27:51 PM] Yi Kai: Yah
[27/3/19, 10:29:28 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ohhh i kind of get it now
[27/3/19, 10:30:11 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i was trying to find d/dx of x so when i expanded it with the limit thing it gives lim 1
[27/3/19, 10:30:35 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: so d/dx 1 isnt even involved at all
[27/3/19, 10:30:37 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: lol
[27/3/19, 10:30:39 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ok thanks

[29/3/19, 8:30:59 PM] Yi Kai: Pig is too cute
[29/3/19, 8:31:55 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: lol
[29/3/19, 8:57:27 PM] Yi Kai: Can send pic for math assignment

[29/3/19, 10:41:31 PM] Yi Kai: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ol5FI6NjSi4

Actually damn cool
[29/3/19, 10:42:44 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oh lol im subscribed to that channel
[29/3/19, 10:42:48 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i didnt watch it yrt
[29/3/19, 10:44:19 PM] Yi Kai: Oh lol
[29/3/19, 10:44:24 PM] Yi Kai: I got bored of tuition homework
[29/3/19, 10:45:58 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: u finished math?
[29/3/19, 10:47:21 PM] Yi Kai: No
[29/3/19, 10:47:25 PM] Yi Kai: Tuition on sunday
[29/3/19, 10:47:31 PM] Yi Kai: Math just differentiation won't be hard
[29/3/19, 10:50:53 PM] Yi Kai: You doing math ah
[29/3/19, 11:01:22 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: trying to
[29/3/19, 11:01:37 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i took cos 2pi as cos180° so yeah
[29/3/19, 11:03:08 PM] Yi Kai: Lol i did that during ct then spent a lot of time on last question, then no time to check through to avoid my random retarded mistakes
[30/3/19, 7:06:07 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: lol
[31/3/19, 4:31:46 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: r u going cd
[31/3/19, 4:33:56 PM] Yi Kai: I lazy
[31/3/19, 4:33:59 PM] Yi Kai: You going?
[31/3/19, 4:34:05 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: idk sia
[31/3/19, 4:34:08 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: idm going
[31/3/19, 4:34:52 PM] Yi Kai: Lol same, but then if I go it's like 40% of my monthly expenditure
[31/3/19, 4:35:09 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: wait what
[31/3/19, 4:35:23 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: u get 45 per month
[31/3/19, 4:35:31 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: use*
[31/3/19, 4:42:04 PM] Yi Kai: I use around 50-60 per month why
[31/3/19, 4:42:34 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: wth
[31/3/19, 4:42:35 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: so little
[31/3/19, 4:42:45 PM] Yi Kai: I mean like ideally lah
[31/3/19, 4:42:48 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i use 25 per week
[31/3/19, 4:42:57 PM] Yi Kai: I'm never so extreme
[31/3/19, 4:43:03 PM] Yi Kai: Unless there's like unit retreat
[31/3/19, 4:43:12 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oh
[31/3/19, 4:48:24 PM] Yi Kai: Is that still very little
[31/3/19, 4:48:50 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: what is
[31/3/19, 4:53:33 PM] Yi Kai: Around 60 per month
[31/3/19, 4:53:43 PM] Yi Kai: Include transport
[31/3/19, 4:53:56 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: very
[31/3/19, 5:03:01 PM] Yi Kai: I'm surprised
[31/3/19, 5:03:16 PM] Yi Kai: But then again, I think you can kinda tell from the way I buy stuff
[31/3/19, 5:05:04 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: how do u buy stuff
[31/3/19, 5:05:09 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: u dont buy anyth
[31/3/19, 5:05:23 PM] Yi Kai: Recess & lunch
[31/3/19, 5:05:33 PM] Yi Kai: Plus I eat lunch in school even if I can go straight home
[31/3/19, 5:05:55 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oh lol
[31/3/19, 5:06:14 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i always eat outside
[31/3/19, 5:06:28 PM] Yi Kai: Oh no wonder lah lol
[31/3/19, 5:06:37 PM] Yi Kai: 'Cause for dinner I usually eat at home
[31/3/19, 5:06:57 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: dinner i also eat at home
[31/3/19, 5:07:11 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: but if im dismissed at 130i usually eat outside
[31/3/19, 5:07:15 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: but thats only 1 day
[31/3/19, 5:08:24 PM] Yi Kai: Oh
[31/3/19, 5:13:18 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: my house there no nice food one
[31/3/19, 5:13:24 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: generally
[31/3/19, 5:13:36 PM] Yi Kai: Like at home or around your house?
[31/3/19, 5:13:45 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: around my house
[31/3/19, 5:13:58 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: its like coffee shops
[31/3/19, 5:14:29 PM] Yi Kai: Oh
[3/4/19, 7:54:29 PM] Yi Kai: Did maumu give any worksheets? And did you submit my math assignment lol
[3/4/19, 8:16:15 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: both yes
[3/4/19, 8:16:22 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: he gave a tangent and normal ws
[3/4/19, 9:31:21 PM] Yi Kai: Ok then I’ll go find him tomorrow
[3/4/19, 9:31:57 PM] Yi Kai: Tbh isn’t that damn simple

Differentiate to find gradient
Then there’s a point Liao so yah
For normal, rotating line 90 degrees just take -1/m
[3/4/19, 9:34:06 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ya lol
[3/4/19, 10:02:17 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: makes sense
[3/4/19, 10:02:25 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: why is yiqin claiming only now
[3/4/19, 10:03:00 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: he was the one who refused to pay last time
[3/4/19, 10:11:13 PM] Yi Kai: Exactly
[3/4/19, 10:11:55 PM] Yi Kai: I intentionally wrote Ng there like 3-4 times 'cause she's too retarded sometimes lol
[4/4/19, 6:17:17 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ya
[4/4/19, 8:48:01 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: does oxygen gas attack metals to form metal oxides during electrolysis like how it attacks graphite electrodes
[4/4/19, 8:48:32 PM] Yi Kai: Not really
[4/4/19, 8:48:42 PM] Yi Kai: But then it can rust
[4/4/19, 8:48:56 PM] Yi Kai: Anyway you chem Olympiad and I honestly don’t know
[4/4/19, 8:48:57 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: isnt that forming the metal oxides
[4/4/19, 8:49:00 PM] Yi Kai: I don’t intend to Mug
[4/4/19, 8:49:01 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: hey!
[4/4/19, 8:49:06 PM] Yi Kai: Only some metals rust
[4/4/19, 8:49:07 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: chem o doesnt teach this
[4/4/19, 8:49:10 PM] Yi Kai: Fine
[4/4/19, 8:49:12 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oh
[4/4/19, 8:49:28 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ok thanks
[4/4/19, 8:49:32 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: still need pin uni
[4/4/19, 8:49:32 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: sian
[5/4/19, 7:02:49 AM] Yi Kai: So it does right?
[5/4/19, 7:03:08 AM] Yi Kai: Anyway did you bring electrolysis notes? I need to read through it
[5/4/19, 7:06:30 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: [04/04, 9:16 pm] Boston: does oxygen attack metal electrodes to form metal oxides like how it attacks graphite electrodes
[05/04, 12:41 am] Neo Shao Jun: Um usually no
[05/04, 12:41 am] Neo Shao Jun: Cause it dissolves or something
[05/04, 12:41 am] Neo Shao Jun: Then theres no such thing as platinum oxide
[5/4/19, 7:06:47 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: err yes buf i will reach at 745
[5/4/19, 7:14:13 AM] Yi Kai: Ok lol
[6/4/19, 10:47:57 PM] Yi Kai: Ugh I can’t tolerate the fact that I wasted all my time today
[6/4/19, 10:54:14 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: what did u do
[6/4/19, 11:18:58 PM] Yi Kai: I did math assignment in the morning

Then the rest of the day I legit didn’t do anything much. Just YouTube and surviv.io (I got lucky enough to get 5 kills once lol)
[6/4/19, 11:21:23 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oh lol
[6/4/19, 11:21:42 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i only did math assignment and worksheet also
[6/4/19, 11:22:30 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: everytime i decide to do work i tell myself 1 game of chess before i start doing work since its just 2 mins long but then i end up playing like multiple games
[7/4/19, 1:16:45 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: does a straw have 1 hole or 2 holes
[7/4/19, 9:04:59 AM] Yi Kai: Same
[7/4/19, 9:05:02 AM] Yi Kai: 2
[7/4/19, 9:05:08 AM] Yi Kai: Why you don’t sleep at 1.16
[7/4/19, 9:36:21 AM] Yi Kai: As in why you still awake
[7/4/19, 9:53:06 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: 1
[7/4/19, 9:53:16 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: idk i dont sleep early on saturdays
[7/4/19, 9:53:22 AM] Yi Kai: Why
[7/4/19, 9:53:39 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: its 1 continuous hole
[7/4/19, 9:54:01 AM] Yi Kai: Ok fine
[7/4/19, 9:54:07 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: lol
[7/4/19, 9:54:13 AM] Yi Kai: It’s very late...

Not not early
[7/4/19, 9:54:28 AM] Yi Kai: What does your previous water bottle say)
[7/4/19, 9:54:30 AM] Yi Kai: ?
[7/4/19, 9:54:39 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: 🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔
[7/4/19, 9:54:42 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: hmmmmmm
[7/4/19, 9:54:53 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: it says eplas
[7/4/19, 9:54:58 AM] Yi Kai: Previous
[7/4/19, 9:55:01 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: idk what ure talking about
[7/4/19, 9:55:07 AM] Yi Kai: Branded jiu niao

[7/4/19, 1:06:03 PM] Yi Kai: Now I see where you took this from after going to youtube
[7/4/19, 1:06:43 PM] Yi Kai: The pewdiepie thing though
[7/4/19, 1:19:04 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: lol
[7/4/19, 1:19:08 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i didnt watch this
[7/4/19, 1:50:09 PM] Yi Kai: So boliao video, no point watching
[7/4/19, 1:50:21 PM] Yi Kai: Mark Rober’s channel is also not bad
[7/4/19, 3:51:49 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oo
[7/4/19, 3:51:51 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: try nilered
[7/4/19, 3:51:54 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: if u want chem
[7/4/19, 6:00:14 PM] Yi Kai: Lol ok
[7/4/19, 7:00:24 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: tmr dont need bring pe right
[7/4/19, 7:00:33 PM] Yi Kai: Don’t think so
[7/4/19, 7:03:40 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oh ok
[8/4/19, 6:34:22 AM] Yi Kai: hi did u bring ur consent form n money
[8/4/19, 6:34:22 AM] Yi Kai: Sorry I’m not going
[8/4/19, 6:34:22 AM] Yi Kai: This is about CD right?
[8/4/19, 6:34:29 AM] Yi Kai: Ok I feel bad now
[8/4/19, 6:42:54 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: lol
[8/4/19, 6:42:58 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i guess
[9/4/19, 9:21:17 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: have u done the math ws
[9/4/19, 9:23:21 PM] Yi Kai: Jump here jump there do one
[9/4/19, 9:23:25 PM] Yi Kai: Just do math AS lol
[9/4/19, 9:23:26 PM] Yi Kai: why
[9/4/19, 9:23:28 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: lol
[9/4/19, 9:23:31 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i finished alr
[9/4/19, 9:23:39 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: how do u do the first derivative test
[9/4/19, 9:24:01 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: like at this stationary point how do u find the gradient before and after the point
[9/4/19, 9:27:09 PM] Yi Kai: Ok just sketch the graph of the dy/dx
[9/4/19, 9:27:19 PM] Yi Kai: Then it's quite obvious since you can see how it crosses the x-axis
[9/4/19, 9:27:32 PM] Yi Kai: If not just do the +-+- thing which I don't know if maumu accepts
[9/4/19, 9:27:37 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: but my dydx is some weird thing
‎[9/4/19, 9:27:44 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ‎image omitted
[9/4/19, 9:27:49 PM] Yi Kai: Like segment the graph into parts, dividing at parts where dy/dx=0. Then at each portion just do a random test
[9/4/19, 9:27:55 PM] Yi Kai: It's correct
[9/4/19, 9:28:04 PM] Yi Kai: Then you know where it cuts the x-axis
[9/4/19, 9:28:15 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ya
[9/4/19, 9:28:28 PM] Yi Kai: Then you divide the graph into those segments (like number line) then you do the +-+- thing

Like at each segment you find polarity
[9/4/19, 9:28:42 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oh
[9/4/19, 9:28:46 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: omg i alr used the whole page
[9/4/19, 9:29:18 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ok thanks
[9/4/19, 9:29:46 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: why is gerald giving full u
[9/4/19, 9:29:48 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: uiwidjdjdjdi
[9/4/19, 9:30:26 PM] Yi Kai: How I know
[9/4/19, 9:30:36 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: its damn retarded
[9/4/19, 9:30:46 PM] Yi Kai: I feedback then everyone just bluetick
[9/4/19, 9:30:57 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: cause they dont wanna do anything
[9/4/19, 9:31:37 PM] Yi Kai: I mean like you unofficially change to half u also can right
[9/4/19, 9:32:05 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: idk if maumu will screw them for that
[9/4/19, 9:34:35 PM] Yi Kai: I think that's why they don't care to change
[9/4/19, 9:35:03 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: true
[9/4/19, 11:15:08 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: why is d2y/dx2 = 0 at a stationary point of inflection
[9/4/19, 11:15:16 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: doesnt gradient of the graph change
[10/4/19, 5:54:27 AM] Yi Kai: Yes
[10/4/19, 5:54:38 AM] Yi Kai: But then the change in the gradient can be 0 at an instant
[10/4/19, 6:21:16 AM] Yi Kai: Like let’s say at quadratic graph you could say that the graph should always be changing then there shouldn’t be like a turning point right
[10/4/19, 6:22:40 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i mean even at the turning point its still changing
[10/4/19, 6:24:32 AM] Yi Kai: The gradient is 0 at one point?
[10/4/19, 6:24:48 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: but at the next point its not 0 anymore
[10/4/19, 6:25:03 AM] Yi Kai: Like if you find the third derivative it can still be changing
[10/4/19, 6:25:22 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: anyways the worksheet says d2y/dx2 of turning points are non zero
[10/4/19, 6:25:26 AM] Yi Kai: That’s why it’s a turning point not inflexion
[10/4/19, 6:25:36 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i dont get the difference
[10/4/19, 6:26:20 AM] Yi Kai: This means the the graph of dy/dx is at a turning point of sorts
[10/4/19, 6:26:32 AM] Yi Kai: So it’s inflexion
[10/4/19, 6:27:43 AM] Yi Kai: If not, the graph of the gradient just cuts through x-axis, then not inflexion anymore
[10/4/19, 6:27:59 AM] Yi Kai: I don’t know how to explain
[10/4/19, 6:28:13 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: lol nvm thanks
[10/4/19, 6:28:18 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: it doesnt make sense logically
[10/4/19, 6:29:05 AM] Yi Kai: It does...
[10/4/19, 6:29:18 AM] Yi Kai: Think of an inflexion point, how will the gradient change?
[10/4/19, 6:29:23 AM] Yi Kai: Like x^3
[10/4/19, 6:29:39 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: gradient 0 to positive gradient
[10/4/19, 6:29:48 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: at 0 0
[10/4/19, 6:29:53 AM] Yi Kai: And before it’s gradient 0 at 0?
[10/4/19, 6:30:06 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: positive also
[10/4/19, 6:30:08 AM] Yi Kai: Yah
[10/4/19, 6:30:11 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: but different gradient
[10/4/19, 6:30:30 AM] Yi Kai: Ok
[10/4/19, 6:30:40 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: doenst this mean that the gradient is changing and the change in gradient isnt 0
[10/4/19, 6:30:57 AM] Yi Kai: So this means that the graph increases decreasingly to 0, then continue increase increasingly
[10/4/19, 6:31:08 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: yah
[10/4/19, 6:31:22 AM] Yi Kai: Kind of, since it’s turning point it’s a 0
[10/4/19, 6:31:41 AM] Yi Kai: It’s kinda hard to explain with words
[10/4/19, 6:31:55 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: then the change in gradient should be positive what
[10/4/19, 6:32:03 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: true
[10/4/19, 6:32:14 AM] Yi Kai: At the turning point of a graph why would the gradient be positive
[10/4/19, 6:32:40 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: as in the change in gradient
[10/4/19, 6:35:10 AM] Yi Kai: Ok yes
[10/4/19, 6:35:14 AM] Yi Kai: Wait no
[10/4/19, 6:35:39 AM] Yi Kai: The graph of the gradient (2x^2) will reach the turning point then, so gradient is 0
[10/4/19, 6:50:50 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: wait wth
[10/4/19, 6:55:37 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: the gradient will always still reach 0 right
[10/4/19, 6:55:56 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: as in y = 0
[10/4/19, 6:56:01 AM] Yi Kai: Yes
[10/4/19, 6:56:17 AM] Yi Kai: The gradient of the gradient is 0*
[10/4/19, 6:56:35 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: isnt the gradient of the gradient 4x
[10/4/19, 6:56:50 AM] Yi Kai: Yes
[10/4/19, 6:56:54 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: wait it should be 6z
[10/4/19, 6:56:58 AM] Yi Kai: So when x is 0, it will be 0
[10/4/19, 6:57:01 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: its 3x^2
[10/4/19, 6:57:09 AM] Yi Kai: Doesn’t matter
[10/4/19, 6:58:10 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: can a quadratic graph have a stationary point of inflection
[10/4/19, 6:58:12 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: no right
[10/4/19, 6:58:20 AM] Yi Kai: Cannot
[10/4/19, 6:58:32 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: cause the second derivative is always a constant
[10/4/19, 6:58:35 AM] Yi Kai: At such a point the gradient of the gradient has to be 0
[10/4/19, 6:58:50 AM] Yi Kai: Yah
[10/4/19, 7:05:18 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ohh
[10/4/19, 11:32:31 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i won the game
[10/4/19, 6:26:50 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ???
[10/4/19, 6:27:11 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: is ng pissed or smth
[10/4/19, 6:31:49 PM] Yi Kai: I don't know, maybe 'cause of jennywong advice or 'cause a lot of people don't submit
[10/4/19, 7:22:28 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: hmm
[10/4/19, 7:22:31 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: its a relief though
[10/4/19, 7:22:39 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: btw do u know whats tested for physics
[10/4/19, 7:58:00 PM] Yi Kai: Up to dc circuit
[10/4/19, 7:58:19 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: is practical electricity included
[10/4/19, 7:58:28 PM] Yi Kai: Probably no
[10/4/19, 7:58:36 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oh yay
[10/4/19, 7:58:43 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i just realised we have so much time tmr
[10/4/19, 7:58:51 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: theres only 1 lesson which is ses
[10/4/19, 8:00:25 PM] Yi Kai: Oh great
[10/4/19, 8:00:34 PM] Yi Kai: But then I don't have much left needed to do
[10/4/19, 8:00:37 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: but then i dont really have anything to do
[10/4/19, 8:00:39 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ya lol
[10/4/19, 8:02:03 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: we are released at 12 tmr right?
[10/4/19, 8:02:08 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: and report at 1 at cheng yi audi
[10/4/19, 8:03:20 PM] Yi Kai: Yes
[10/4/19, 8:03:23 PM] Yi Kai: 12.30

[10/4/19, 8:06:52 PM] Yi Kai: More importantly, it's at JC
[10/4/19, 8:07:21 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ya
[10/4/19, 10:17:19 PM] Yi Kai: Shall I bring com tomorrow
[10/4/19, 10:17:28 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: what for
[10/4/19, 10:26:23 PM] Yi Kai: I don't know lol
[10/4/19, 10:30:46 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: can we use it during fdfd
[11/4/19, 6:01:36 AM] Yi Kai: I don’t know, that’s why I considered
[11/4/19, 6:48:13 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: lol i dont think we can use it during fdfd
[11/4/19, 6:48:17 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: it looks v obvious
[11/4/19, 7:44:42 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: potassiumdichromate
[11/4/19, 7:44:45 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: im a mugger
[11/4/19, 7:47:03 AM] Yi Kai: Why you can not login though
[11/4/19, 7:47:26 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: idk why i tried it aays its connected to my facebook account
[11/4/19, 7:47:39 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: but then i logged in with my fb account and it made me create a new account
[11/4/19, 1:48:41 PM] Yi Kai: You just left?

[11/4/19, 2:22:22 PM] Yi Kai: I legit feel like leaving siah
[11/4/19, 2:22:29 PM] Yi Kai: Pangs speech so damn boring
[11/4/19, 2:22:33 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: lol did everyone see us leaving
[11/4/19, 2:22:36 PM] Yi Kai: A lot
[11/4/19, 2:22:39 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: leave lor

[11/4/19, 2:22:58 PM] Yi Kai: Should have brought com
[11/4/19, 2:23:15 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i brought my comp
[11/4/19, 2:23:21 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: but then my seat so trash
[11/4/19, 2:23:31 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: its like rifht in the middle
[11/4/19, 2:23:44 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i actually wanted to mug there
[12/4/19, 6:35:03 AM] Yi Kai: Not bringing full u feels so weird
[12/4/19, 6:35:16 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: lol
[12/4/19, 6:35:25 AM] Yi Kai: I keep feeling like I forgot something especially since I think I dreamt there’s muster parade today
[12/4/19, 6:35:34 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: wow
[12/4/19, 6:35:37 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: enthu kid
[12/4/19, 6:35:53 AM] Yi Kai: So after I woke up I went to check again
[12/4/19, 6:35:54 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: 1st class may be doing muster though
[12/4/19, 6:36:02 AM] Yi Kai: Anyway I prep full u liao
[12/4/19, 6:36:07 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i never
[12/4/19, 6:36:11 AM] Yi Kai: Wot, as in for training?
[12/4/19, 6:36:16 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: at least u can use it next time
[12/4/19, 6:36:17 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ya
[12/4/19, 6:36:42 AM] Yi Kai: True, just hope next time isn’t test
[12/4/19, 6:36:55 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: lol
[12/4/19, 6:37:07 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: 3 may is 1st class
[12/4/19, 6:37:20 AM] Yi Kai: That’s quite soon
[12/4/19, 6:37:26 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: and next week is good friday
[12/4/19, 6:37:32 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: so theres 1 week
[12/4/19, 6:37:34 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: 26 april
[12/4/19, 6:37:36 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: idk what we doing
[12/4/19, 6:37:38 AM] Yi Kai: Oh wow
[12/4/19, 7:26:08 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: do u check reliability for surprise qn
[12/4/19, 7:26:08 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: for example a nazi leader talking bad about nazis means ure surprised
[12/4/19, 7:26:09 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: dont u just see if the guy is arguing against his interests
‎[13/4/19, 3:37:59 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ‎image omitted
[13/4/19, 3:40:04 PM] Yi Kai: Which drop is on top?
[13/4/19, 3:40:11 PM] Yi Kai: 'Cause there's no label for drop 1
[13/4/19, 3:40:12 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: drop 2
[13/4/19, 3:40:16 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: drop 1 is below
[13/4/19, 3:40:23 PM] Yi Kai: Ok that makes sense
[13/4/19, 3:40:37 PM] Yi Kai: So at first the net charge of the drop is negative right
[13/4/19, 3:40:45 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: which drop
[13/4/19, 3:40:46 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: 2 ah
[13/4/19, 3:40:48 PM] Yi Kai: But then the clouds and the building will induce charges
[13/4/19, 3:41:01 PM] Yi Kai: After touching before separating
[13/4/19, 3:41:16 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: why is it negative
[13/4/19, 3:41:27 PM] Yi Kai: So the stuff on top tends to be more negative, the stuff below tends to be more positive
[13/4/19, 3:41:51 PM] Yi Kai: 'Cause at first drop 1 is negative
[13/4/19, 3:41:56 PM] Yi Kai: At first drop 2 is neutral right?
[13/4/19, 3:41:59 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: doesnt the stuff below  tend to be more negative cus its closer to the negative side
[13/4/19, 3:42:03 PM] Yi Kai: No
[13/4/19, 3:42:15 PM] Yi Kai: Negative charge on building attracts positive charges
[13/4/19, 3:42:25 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ohhh
[13/4/19, 3:42:56 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ^
[13/4/19, 3:43:07 PM] Yi Kai: ^
[13/4/19, 3:43:13 PM] Yi Kai: Then drop 2 is neutral
[13/4/19, 3:43:57 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: omg what
[13/4/19, 3:44:12 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: if drop 1 is negative shouldnt drop 2 be positive
[13/4/19, 3:44:15 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: before they touch
[13/4/19, 3:45:31 PM] Yi Kai: No
[13/4/19, 3:45:53 PM] Yi Kai: The net charge of drop 2 is just neutral, even if one side is induced positive charges the other side is induced with negative charges
[13/4/19, 3:45:56 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i need to revise physics lol
[13/4/19, 3:46:24 PM] Yi Kai: When's the test ah?
[13/4/19, 3:46:26 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: the net charge is also neutral for drop 1?
[13/4/19, 3:46:30 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: next next friday
[13/4/19, 3:46:59 PM] Yi Kai: I keep forgetting I need to do 新闻分享
[13/4/19, 3:47:05 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oh
[13/4/19, 3:47:15 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: idw it to be me again
[13/4/19, 3:47:22 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: can u pluck an article from his classroom
[13/4/19, 3:47:23 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: lol
[13/4/19, 3:47:25 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: help
[13/4/19, 3:47:38 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: isnt the net charge of both drops neutral before they touch
[13/4/19, 3:47:53 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: what does the electric field do
[13/4/19, 3:48:51 PM] Yi Kai: No point if he ask me to redo
[13/4/19, 3:49:00 PM] Yi Kai: I don't know the question
[13/4/19, 3:49:33 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: nvm i dao the question
[13/4/19, 3:49:38 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ill just revise
[13/4/19, 3:49:38 PM] Yi Kai: Quite sure someone talked about the 幸福感 before right
[13/4/19, 3:49:44 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: got point for the rest of us
[13/4/19, 3:49:48 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i think so
[13/4/19, 3:49:52 PM] Yi Kai: Lol ok
[13/4/19, 3:49:55 PM] Yi Kai: Why
[13/4/19, 3:50:03 PM] Yi Kai: Legit pointless lah
[13/4/19, 3:50:08 PM] Yi Kai: Prolong my worrying for a day
[13/4/19, 3:51:04 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: delay our 新闻分享 like sean
[13/4/19, 3:51:04 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: lol
[13/4/19, 3:53:46 PM] Yi Kai: Should I talk about streaming or https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/volunteers-ex-offenders-selling-keychains-soft-toys-not-from-yellow-ribbon
[13/4/19, 4:24:12 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: both also can
[13/4/19, 4:24:41 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i think the yellow ribbon easier to smoke
[13/4/19, 4:24:45 PM] Yi Kai: True
[13/4/19, 4:24:52 PM] Yi Kai: But zhiheng say streaming someone say before though
[13/4/19, 4:24:53 PM] Yi Kai: I not sure
[13/4/19, 4:25:03 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: just write ue script like how u write 材料作文
[13/4/19, 4:25:04 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: lol
[13/4/19, 4:25:15 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: its quite probable
[13/4/19, 4:25:16 PM] Yi Kai: Then zhiheng decided to suggest about new zealand shooting
[13/4/19, 4:25:20 PM] Yi Kai: Yah
[13/4/19, 4:25:38 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: up to u
[13/4/19, 4:41:51 PM] Yi Kai: What's the duration ah
[13/4/19, 4:44:00 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: quite short
[13/4/19, 4:44:05 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: 2 to 3 mins i guess
[13/4/19, 4:44:15 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: im pretty sure i spoke for v little time
[13/4/19, 4:44:29 PM] Yi Kai: 2 minutes damn easy lol
[13/4/19, 4:44:46 PM] Yi Kai: I speak chinese quite slowly if I'm reading off, plus if I impromptu I stutter a lot
[13/4/19, 4:44:57 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oh
[13/4/19, 4:45:05 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ure going to impromptu
[13/4/19, 4:45:06 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ?
[13/4/19, 4:45:17 PM] Yi Kai: I considering
[13/4/19, 4:45:28 PM] Yi Kai: Impromptu as in jot down all my points then just talk
[13/4/19, 4:45:45 PM] Yi Kai: Like for my morning announcement I just memorised, this one I don't think can
[13/4/19, 4:46:22 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oh
[13/4/19, 4:46:29 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: it sounded a bit rigid lol
[13/4/19, 4:46:39 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i think u were nervous
[13/4/19, 4:48:49 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: Remember, you already owe us 300 push ups, if you want to increase the count, carry on with your current behaviour.
[13/4/19, 4:48:53 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: lol wow
[13/4/19, 4:49:15 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i rmb we owed batch 48 100+ pushups but in the end we didnt pay it off
[13/4/19, 4:54:44 PM] Yi Kai: 48 or 47 lol
[13/4/19, 4:54:52 PM] Yi Kai: Quite
[13/4/19, 4:56:15 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i think chin howes batxh
[13/4/19, 4:56:18 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: so 48
[13/4/19, 4:57:14 PM] Yi Kai: Nvm I cleared chat
[13/4/19, 4:57:29 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: hmm
[13/4/19, 4:58:09 PM] Yi Kai: I think for 47 one we payed it
‎[13/4/19, 5:00:08 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ‎image omitted
[13/4/19, 5:01:39 PM] Yi Kai: For the number she underlined, where does it come from
[13/4/19, 5:01:49 PM] Yi Kai: Wait nvm
[13/4/19, 5:03:09 PM] Yi Kai: Wth you doing
[13/4/19, 5:03:58 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: sum of voltage across thermistor and 6.0ohm resistor = total voltage
[13/4/19, 5:04:11 PM] Yi Kai: The max voltage of the resistor isn't 1.5v
[13/4/19, 5:04:30 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: huh
[13/4/19, 5:04:42 PM] Yi Kai: Yah
[13/4/19, 5:04:45 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: u mean the voltage isnt constant
[13/4/19, 5:04:52 PM] Yi Kai: At 100 degrees the thermistor still has resistance
[13/4/19, 5:05:02 PM] Yi Kai: So the voltage of the 6 ohm resistor isn't 1.5
[13/4/19, 5:05:13 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: its not what
[13/4/19, 5:05:18 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: total voltage is 1.5
[13/4/19, 5:05:57 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i took total voltage - voltage across thermistor to find voltage across 6.0ohm
[13/4/19, 5:06:44 PM] Yi Kai: I don't know, you ask Ng lorh
[13/4/19, 5:06:53 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: lol ok
[13/4/19, 5:06:55 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: wth
[13/4/19, 5:07:06 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: both methods seem fine
[13/4/19, 5:09:03 PM] Yi Kai: Mathematically, both gives same result
[13/4/19, 5:09:15 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: u mean supposed to
[13/4/19, 5:09:41 PM] Yi Kai: You press calculator wrong lah...
[13/4/19, 5:09:52 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: wheree
[13/4/19, 5:10:06 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i check alr
‎[13/4/19, 5:10:33 PM] Yi Kai: ‎image omitted
[13/4/19, 5:10:47 PM] Yi Kai: a is your answer from part a

[13/4/19, 5:11:25 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: wts
[13/4/19, 5:12:00 PM] Yi Kai: Your one doesn't know bodmas
[13/4/19, 5:12:18 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i put bracket it still gives the same answer
‎[13/4/19, 5:12:51 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ‎image omitted
[13/4/19, 5:12:56 PM] Yi Kai: Actually it's sf
[13/4/19, 5:13:32 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: the sf is so far away
[13/4/19, 5:13:44 PM] Yi Kai: 0.005859375
[13/4/19, 5:13:50 PM] Yi Kai: Quite huge digits behind
[13/4/19, 5:14:06 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: u mean that accuracy affected it so much
[13/4/19, 5:14:16 PM] Yi Kai: Yes...
[13/4/19, 5:14:20 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: omg
[13/4/19, 5:14:48 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: but arent we supposed to use the evaluated sf answer
[13/4/19, 5:14:55 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: every year im askimg the same thing
[13/4/19, 5:15:53 PM] Yi Kai: No
[13/4/19, 5:16:09 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i always use the evaluated one
[13/4/19, 5:16:17 PM] Yi Kai: Just know how many sf it's supposed to be, then when you press calculator just use exact value
[13/4/19, 5:16:22 PM] Yi Kai: Rely on rng lorh
[13/4/19, 5:16:29 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ouch
[13/4/19, 5:16:35 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ok thanks
[13/4/19, 8:07:25 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: is there napfa is jc
[13/4/19, 8:07:28 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: in
[13/4/19, 8:07:29 PM] Yi Kai: Yes
[13/4/19, 8:07:31 PM] Yi Kai: J2
[13/4/19, 8:07:38 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oh no
[13/4/19, 8:07:56 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: wait if u pass napfa before ns u get shorter time right
[13/4/19, 8:08:02 PM] Yi Kai: Yah
[13/4/19, 8:08:04 PM] Yi Kai: Something like that
[13/4/19, 8:08:14 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: thats my motivation to pass napfa
[13/4/19, 8:08:53 PM] Yi Kai: Lol
[13/4/19, 8:09:04 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i cant do pullups though
[13/4/19, 8:09:04 PM] Yi Kai: I can't bear to think of NS siah
[13/4/19, 8:09:05 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: help
[13/4/19, 8:09:08 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: why
[13/4/19, 8:09:14 PM] Yi Kai: It's scarier than the working world which is scary enough
[13/4/19, 8:09:16 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: its just an extended version of np
[13/4/19, 8:09:24 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: the working world is probably scarier
[13/4/19, 8:09:36 PM] Yi Kai: I don't know
[13/4/19, 8:09:44 PM] Yi Kai: Well NP has been damn slack

[13/4/19, 8:11:18 PM] Yi Kai: PT isn't that bad, to me this kind of stuff I only care about 1. getting to bathe, which you don't get to sometimes, and 2. minimal wounds, which doesn't happen
[13/4/19, 8:11:24 PM] Yi Kai: Ok fine
[13/4/19, 8:11:29 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: they probably made the stuff slacker now with all the ns incidents

[13/4/19, 8:12:38 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: the pillow or what
[13/4/19, 8:12:59 PM] Yi Kai: Like essentially there are some things I know how it's done, but when I can't do it I just can't get through, unlike many of the other NOI peeps
[13/4/19, 8:13:10 PM] Yi Kai: Mug or pencil case, more durable
[13/4/19, 8:13:20 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oh
[13/4/19, 8:13:25 PM] Yi Kai: The painting is like $120+ so definitely no

[13/4/19, 8:14:50 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: its damn random
[13/4/19, 8:15:01 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: siao
[13/4/19, 8:15:43 PM] Yi Kai: After all my mum emphasized that it's a once-in-a-lifetime thing so they told me I should go gala dinner after I said no to it
[13/4/19, 8:16:16 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: wait u didnt go right

[13/4/19, 8:17:09 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: LOL
[13/4/19, 8:17:20 PM] Yi Kai: Especially my skin, it's always too oily or dry

[13/4/19, 8:18:28 PM] Yi Kai: I don't eat there that often
[13/4/19, 8:19:16 PM] Yi Kai: It's usually too oily. If I listen to my parents and apply pimple cream as directed (twice a day), then it becomes scaly in a week. If not I apply it around once every 2 weeks when I feel that the pimples are getting too big
[13/4/19, 8:20:05 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oh
[13/4/19, 8:20:17 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: did u try other treatment
[13/4/19, 8:20:41 PM] Yi Kai: Antibiotic pills for 2 months
[13/4/19, 8:20:53 PM] Yi Kai: It worked very well, then after that I'm supposed to focus on cream for the last part

[25/4/19, 4:47:58 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: 430*
[25/4/19, 4:48:09 PM] Yi Kai: I mean to me I have the job of timer to them so I should probably go not so late
[25/4/19, 4:48:11 PM] Yi Kai: Maybe 3.30
[25/4/19, 4:48:35 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ahh
[25/4/19, 4:50:15 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: nvm i see what shaojun do
[25/4/19, 4:50:32 PM] Yi Kai: Lol
[25/4/19, 4:50:41 PM] Yi Kai: He's the latest among us I think
[25/4/19, 5:15:54 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i think so
[25/4/19, 5:41:48 PM] Yi Kai: Should I polish boots for tomorrow?
[25/4/19, 7:52:58 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: nope
[25/4/19, 8:27:47 PM] Yi Kai: Ok then, dao it is
[25/4/19, 8:28:40 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: yay
[25/4/19, 8:28:51 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i havent started revising cause i slept from 5+ to 8
[25/4/19, 8:28:52 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: wth
[25/4/19, 8:29:35 PM] Yi Kai: Why you sleep 3 hours again
[25/4/19, 8:29:52 PM] Yi Kai: I mean if you want sleep then just set alarm lah
[25/4/19, 8:34:52 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i setted
[25/4/19, 8:34:56 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: but idk when i offed ot
[25/4/19, 8:34:57 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: it
[25/4/19, 8:35:03 PM] Yi Kai: Wow
[25/4/19, 9:23:14 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: so which topic is gonna come out
[25/4/19, 9:23:15 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: lol
[25/4/19, 9:44:08 PM] Yi Kai: I don't know
‎[25/4/19, 9:57:02 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ‎image omitted
[25/4/19, 9:59:53 PM] Yi Kai: Nani
[25/4/19, 9:59:58 PM] Yi Kai: What's the answer
[25/4/19, 10:00:02 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: A
[25/4/19, 10:00:03 PM] Yi Kai: Isn't B correct though
[25/4/19, 10:00:17 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: B is supposed to be correct if u sub in 0 and 10^7
[25/4/19, 10:00:18 PM] Yi Kai: Ask Ng
[25/4/19, 10:00:23 PM] Yi Kai: Yes
[25/4/19, 10:00:40 PM] Yi Kai: Given the existance of the resistors you can't have like a resistance of 1 ohm
[25/4/19, 10:00:44 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i thought the class chat they say what path of negligible resistance
[25/4/19, 10:01:05 PM] Yi Kai: Bhe path below always has one of 10^4 ohm
[25/4/19, 10:01:17 PM] Yi Kai: The one on top at minimum has resistance of 10 ohm
[25/4/19, 10:01:26 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: but 10^7 compared to 10^4 is very large
[25/4/19, 10:01:27 PM] Yi Kai: How to go to like1 ohm?
[25/4/19, 10:01:33 PM] Yi Kai: Yes
[25/4/19, 10:01:35 PM] Yi Kai: Use the formula
[25/4/19, 10:01:36 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: and 10 compared to 10^4 is very small
[25/4/19, 10:01:43 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: wat formula
[25/4/19, 10:01:50 PM] Yi Kai: 1/(1/r1+1/r2)
[25/4/19, 10:02:03 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ya i did that
[25/4/19, 10:02:08 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: u get B if u do that
[25/4/19, 10:02:44 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: wait how does resistance go to zero
[25/4/19, 10:02:45 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: lol
[25/4/19, 10:02:56 PM] Yi Kai: ^^
[25/4/19, 10:02:58 PM] Yi Kai: Just ask her
[25/4/19, 10:03:06 PM] Yi Kai: Probably keyed in the answers wrongly
[25/4/19, 10:03:28 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: unless ure saying that 10ohm resistor path is counted as negligible resistance
[25/4/19, 10:04:14 PM] Yi Kai: Can't be
‎[25/4/19, 10:36:57 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ‎image omitted
[26/4/19, 6:12:48 AM] Yi Kai: Think of V2 to be across the whole parallel section, or just one of the branches, and it’ll be 2V assuming ammeter has negligible resistance
[26/4/19, 6:38:45 AM] Yi Kai: Oh no I think I’ll be the only one wearing dress down during CT
[26/4/19, 6:59:19 AM] Yi Kai: You woke up late or something?
[26/4/19, 7:11:21 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: yes
[26/4/19, 7:17:29 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i wore dressdown
[26/4/19, 7:17:36 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: r u changing for oral
[26/4/19, 8:26:20 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: are the hci websites not accessible or is it just my wifi
[26/4/19, 8:26:28 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i can access other sites though
[26/4/19, 8:26:40 PM] Yi Kai: Let me try
[26/4/19, 8:26:55 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: for the past 2 weeks
[26/4/19, 8:27:00 PM] Yi Kai: Seems to be lagging
[26/4/19, 8:27:04 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: my connection to iemb is like unstable
[26/4/19, 8:27:06 PM] Yi Kai: But just today
[26/4/19, 8:27:14 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: its damn annoying

[26/4/19, 8:27:47 PM] Yi Kai: Use com
[26/4/19, 8:27:50 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: r u signing up for the cip thing
[26/4/19, 8:27:57 PM] Yi Kai: I don’t know
[26/4/19, 8:28:08 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: idk if its worth it to go
[26/4/19, 8:28:09 PM] Yi Kai: Later sign up Liao then never ask whole SM to go
[26/4/19, 8:28:16 PM] Yi Kai: I don’t need the hours
[26/4/19, 8:28:17 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: yah
[26/4/19, 8:28:27 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: technically i dont need too
[26/4/19, 8:28:31 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: but ill have like 11 hours
[26/4/19, 8:28:37 PM] Yi Kai: Just that I need Bernard to push kohkt to give me 30 hours for sabbat
[26/4/19, 8:28:45 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: lol
[26/4/19, 8:28:48 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: scam
[26/4/19, 8:28:54 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: hows that cip though
[26/4/19, 8:29:00 PM] Yi Kai: I don’t know
[26/4/19, 8:29:46 PM] Yi Kai: The Google talk guy was like

I think they should count contributing to open source projects as CIP hours cause doing that helps those startup organisations way more compared to how much normal CIP helps people
[26/4/19, 8:36:22 PM] Yi Kai: But then for emb I can access on com though
[26/4/19, 9:23:38 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: do u do open source projects
[26/4/19, 9:23:39 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: hmm
[26/4/19, 9:24:21 PM] Yi Kai: No
[27/4/19, 2:57:15 PM] Yi Kai: I should probs go to pull-up bars more
[27/4/19, 2:57:22 PM] Yi Kai: But at least now I can do 20 push-ups
[27/4/19, 4:33:13 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: siao
[27/4/19, 4:33:27 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i gave up on exercising after 5 stations ended
[27/4/19, 4:33:29 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: which is bad
[27/4/19, 4:34:02 PM] Yi Kai: Wait what do you usually do?
[27/4/19, 4:34:14 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: idk like situps
[27/4/19, 4:34:17 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: and plank
[27/4/19, 4:34:23 PM] Yi Kai: Wow
[27/4/19, 4:34:28 PM] Yi Kai: I always lazy
[27/4/19, 4:34:33 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i did that everyday at like 1am
[27/4/19, 4:34:34 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: LOL
[27/4/19, 4:34:40 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: now im just tired and lazy
[27/4/19, 4:34:41 PM] Yi Kai: ...
[27/4/19, 4:35:03 PM] Yi Kai: I’m left with just luntan but I’m lazy
[27/4/19, 4:35:14 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: what the heck
[27/4/19, 4:35:17 PM] Yi Kai: Why
[27/4/19, 4:35:30 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i still havr like everythimg
[27/4/19, 4:35:33 PM] Yi Kai: ...
[27/4/19, 4:35:43 PM] Yi Kai: You want play survivio? Sorry I very boliao

[27/4/19, 4:36:11 PM] Yi Kai: Oh that one ah
[27/4/19, 4:36:13 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: lol maybe next time
[27/4/19, 4:36:15 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: bio period
[27/4/19, 4:36:15 PM] Yi Kai: I dao the question
[27/4/19, 4:36:18 PM] Yi Kai: Can
[27/4/19, 4:36:19 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ew
[27/4/19, 4:36:31 PM] Yi Kai: Just dao
[27/4/19, 4:36:34 PM] Yi Kai: Legit
[27/4/19, 4:36:39 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: its like product rule 4 times
[27/4/19, 4:36:40 PM] Yi Kai: If not cannot finish
[27/4/19, 4:36:42 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: dumb dumb
[27/4/19, 4:36:42 PM] Yi Kai: Exactly
[27/4/19, 4:36:51 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: later i need present this
[27/4/19, 4:36:54 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oh wait its probably not me
[27/4/19, 4:37:02 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: mine should be the white ws that we did alr
[27/4/19, 4:38:11 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ok i dao
[27/4/19, 5:02:55 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: are u going for the camp thing on 31 may
[27/4/19, 5:03:01 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i found out that can pon ssg cape
[27/4/19, 5:05:07 PM] Yi Kai: I don't know
[27/4/19, 5:05:16 PM] Yi Kai: Wait it's valid to dao CCA?
[27/4/19, 5:05:24 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: [27/04, 11:41 am] Boston: how long is the experimential camp thing every day
[27/04, 11:41 am] Boston: like what time to what time
[27/04, 11:45 am] Boston: i thought 31 may got lessons so that means we skip lessons for it ah
[27/04, 4:30 pm] Neo Shao Jun: Yep
[27/04, 4:31 pm] Neo Shao Jun: Morning to 5.30
[27/4/19, 5:05:40 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: can skip lessons why cant skip cca
[27/4/19, 5:05:42 PM] Yi Kai: Will NP allow?
[27/4/19, 5:05:55 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: hmm
[27/4/19, 5:06:04 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: but shaojun is the organiser though
[27/4/19, 5:06:09 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: so he probably alr ponning
[27/4/19, 5:07:34 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: its damn stupid if cca takes precedence over everything
[27/4/19, 5:07:55 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: like i couldnt sign up for math olympiad because apparently i have s3 pir interview on the same day
[27/4/19, 5:10:12 PM] Yi Kai: SMO?
[27/4/19, 5:10:21 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ya
[27/4/19, 5:10:46 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i mean i could have signed up but thats burdening malcolm with something he isnt supposed to do
[27/4/19, 5:11:25 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: u want me to ask shaojun if its legal to pon cca for cip
[27/4/19, 5:16:08 PM] Yi Kai: Ok lorh
[27/4/19, 5:16:33 PM] Yi Kai: Up to you lah, SMO isn't that easy
[27/4/19, 5:16:49 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i wanted to go for fun
[27/4/19, 5:18:00 PM] Yi Kai: But then it's one of the easier ones liao
[27/4/19, 5:18:06 PM] Yi Kai: Australian AMC also quite easy
[27/4/19, 5:19:04 PM] Yi Kai: What were your points for luntan
[27/4/19, 5:19:13 PM] Yi Kai: Like why should ppl participate in zero waste
[27/4/19, 5:19:24 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i did dianyou
[27/4/19, 5:20:27 PM] Yi Kai: Ok nvm
[27/4/19, 5:20:41 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: why u want do luntan though
[27/4/19, 5:21:13 PM] Yi Kai: I don't like to write luntan
[27/4/19, 5:21:30 PM] Yi Kai: Don't like to write dianyou*
[27/4/19, 5:21:36 PM] Yi Kai: Unless they ask 2 questions liao
[27/4/19, 5:29:35 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i don't like luntan lol
[27/4/19, 5:29:57 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: anyways olvl chinese is after school ends right
[27/4/19, 6:42:16 PM] Yi Kai: Why
[27/4/19, 7:05:50 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i feel like its a normal compo
[27/4/19, 7:06:02 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: &
[27/4/19, 7:09:12 PM] Yi Kai: True
[27/4/19, 7:09:29 PM] Yi Kai: For main paper
[27/4/19, 7:09:44 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oh ok
[27/4/19, 8:44:02 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: how do u explain why y = x + cos x has no maximum or minimum points
[27/4/19, 8:52:14 PM] Yi Kai: dy/dx is always non-negative
[27/4/19, 8:58:41 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ‎This message was deleted.
[27/4/19, 9:03:32 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ‎This message was deleted.
[27/4/19, 9:04:00 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: omg nvm
[27/4/19, 9:04:07 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: sudden realisations
[27/4/19, 9:10:27 PM] Yi Kai: I'm thinking about creating insta bots
[27/4/19, 9:11:14 PM] Yi Kai: So that I can trash the retarded kind of stuff where they give awards for most liked poster and stuff
[27/4/19, 9:11:30 PM] Yi Kai: Hard part is in creating the accounts though
[27/4/19, 9:19:15 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: lol
[27/4/19, 9:19:24 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: and u need to make the accounts look realistic
[27/4/19, 9:19:46 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: or insta will probably delete them
[27/4/19, 9:22:45 PM] Yi Kai: Like what?
[27/4/19, 9:22:54 PM] Yi Kai: I see online stuff they just randomly follow accounts
[27/4/19, 9:23:04 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: like number of followers
[27/4/19, 9:23:07 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: or like the usernamr
[27/4/19, 9:23:09 PM] Yi Kai: After all my own one seems pretty much like a bot
[27/4/19, 9:23:22 PM] Yi Kai: I made it look like a name
[27/4/19, 9:23:34 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i mean like if the username is like xx92nd8ju8cc then its suspicious
[27/4/19, 9:23:45 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: then the number of followers and following also matters
[27/4/19, 9:24:08 PM] Yi Kai: Followers depends
[27/4/19, 9:24:30 PM] Yi Kai: Or I just make my accounts follow each other lorh
[27/4/19, 9:24:47 PM] Yi Kai: Actually I'll just give them random accounts to follow
[27/4/19, 9:25:41 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: but the random accounts wont follow u
[27/4/19, 9:27:52 PM] Yi Kai: People will follow
[27/4/19, 9:28:01 PM] Yi Kai: that's how luna frankie gets followers
[27/4/19, 9:28:08 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: lol
[27/4/19, 9:28:10 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: do u accept
[27/4/19, 9:31:20 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: wait nvm ure public
[27/4/19, 9:31:28 PM] Yi Kai: Yes
[27/4/19, 9:32:55 PM] Yi Kai: Probably make it randomly like and comment on posts on the timeline
[27/4/19, 9:33:18 PM] Yi Kai: Ok great I finally got liking posts to work
[27/4/19, 9:34:35 PM] Yi Kai: Probs need to use VPN
[27/4/19, 9:34:44 PM] Yi Kai: Anyway this thing is like the same thing I use to hax typing test
[27/4/19, 9:35:25 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: lol
[27/4/19, 9:36:32 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: why need vpn
[27/4/19, 9:37:12 PM] Yi Kai: If not they detect all same com or something
[27/4/19, 9:37:25 PM] Yi Kai: If I vpn at least they may think that many vpn to same server
[27/4/19, 9:37:55 PM] Yi Kai: I like how I'm doing this and not luntan
[27/4/19, 9:40:32 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: u have tmr to do it rhough
[27/4/19, 9:40:35 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oh
[27/4/19, 9:45:28 PM] Yi Kai: I thought that I can just spam create insta accounts with temporary emails
[27/4/19, 9:45:34 PM] Yi Kai: But turns out, instagram bans them
[27/4/19, 9:45:51 PM] Yi Kai: So if I want to use code to create accounts, I need to make it create gmail too
[27/4/19, 9:45:57 PM] Yi Kai: That'll be painful
[27/4/19, 9:46:04 PM] Yi Kai: But I believe in the rewards
[27/4/19, 9:46:25 PM] Yi Kai: I can just sell wenhao likes, since he hides all of his posts with less than 100 likes
[27/4/19, 10:01:59 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: LOL
[27/4/19, 10:02:01 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: wtf
[27/4/19, 10:02:15 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: if he hides his posts then how will he get more likes
[27/4/19, 10:21:49 PM] Yi Kai: He gives up on them
[27/4/19, 10:32:15 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: wth
[27/4/19, 11:10:42 PM] Yi Kai: Good meme I got an instant 2 followers once I ran the code to randomly follow good bunch of people
[27/4/19, 11:48:37 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: hmm
[27/4/19, 11:48:43 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: r u still doing the code
[27/4/19, 11:48:44 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: lol
[28/4/19, 9:07:32 AM] Yi Kai: I was going until like 11.50 cause I couldn’t get logging out and random unfollowing to work

Until I have up cause I have tuition I’m late for
[28/4/19, 9:45:59 AM] Yi Kai: I like how you slept at 3am. Bet you’d wake up at 11.30am
[28/4/19, 11:07:49 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: lol hi
[28/4/19, 11:07:59 AM] Yi Kai: Ah

[28/4/19, 11:29:25 AM] Yi Kai: Yah same
[28/4/19, 11:29:27 AM] Yi Kai: What's your timing
[28/4/19, 11:29:34 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: 13.08
[28/4/19, 11:30:04 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: omg i dont want to be activated
[28/4/19, 11:30:12 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: especially if its drills
[28/4/19, 11:30:17 AM] Yi Kai: Lol
[28/4/19, 11:53:54 AM] Yi Kai: I'm still lazy to finish up my luntan
[28/4/19, 11:54:12 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: lol
[28/4/19, 12:06:47 PM] Yi Kai: Ok my ig code is finally working
[28/4/19, 12:06:58 PM] Yi Kai: Now time to 烦恼 how to spam create accounts
[28/4/19, 12:07:55 PM] Yi Kai: It turns out the accounts that follow mine are bots too lol
[28/4/19, 12:08:51 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: which code
[28/4/19, 12:09:25 PM] Yi Kai: To log in, randomly follow people, unfollow people, and then maybe like some posts, and log out
[28/4/19, 12:09:33 PM] Yi Kai: Then go next account
[28/4/19, 12:10:05 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oh lol
[28/4/19, 12:10:10 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: why need unfollow people though
[28/4/19, 12:12:15 PM] Yi Kai: If not the following numbers spam shoot up
[28/4/19, 12:12:22 PM] Yi Kai: It already follows like 50+
[28/4/19, 12:12:30 PM] Yi Kai: Including moe, which I unfollowed
[28/4/19, 12:12:42 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: LOL
[28/4/19, 12:12:45 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: wth
[28/4/19, 12:12:50 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: did it randomly follow moe
[28/4/19, 12:12:55 PM] Yi Kai: Yes
[28/4/19, 12:13:11 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: amazing bot
[28/4/19, 12:13:24 PM] Yi Kai: I made it look at the list of peeps to follow, then for each person, give it a 25% chance of following
[28/4/19, 12:13:41 PM] Yi Kai: I believe that if luna frankie isn't deleted, same for mine
[28/4/19, 12:13:56 PM] Yi Kai: Oh yah it should randomly comment also right hmm
[28/4/19, 12:14:04 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: why tho
[28/4/19, 12:14:10 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: tbe comments will look like bots
[28/4/19, 12:14:11 PM] Yi Kai: Actually not necessary
[28/4/19, 12:14:16 PM] Yi Kai: True
[28/4/19, 12:16:10 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: their comments are like
[28/4/19, 12:16:13 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: Great post!
[28/4/19, 12:16:21 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: Loving your feed!
[28/4/19, 12:16:28 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: Awesome content!
[28/4/19, 12:16:27 PM] Yi Kai: Insta says it'll use their own bots, use AI, to detect such bots
[28/4/19, 12:16:31 PM] Yi Kai: True
[28/4/19, 12:16:40 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: beat insta
[28/4/19, 12:17:34 PM] Yi Kai: It's not that hard
[28/4/19, 12:17:43 PM] Yi Kai: After all it's AI, which will have loopholes
[28/4/19, 12:17:49 PM] Yi Kai: And I add randomness for a reason
[28/4/19, 1:56:06 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: true
[28/4/19, 1:56:33 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: should i try to study for chem olympiad considering like 20 people got into round 2 last year
[28/4/19, 2:04:13 PM] Yi Kai: You should
[28/4/19, 2:04:31 PM] Yi Kai: Chem isn't NOI which doesn't require memory
[28/4/19, 2:04:45 PM] Yi Kai: At least to me, 'cause math and NOI are like common sense once you understand it
[28/4/19, 2:07:48 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: chem needs memory meh
[28/4/19, 2:07:59 PM] Yi Kai: No need meh?
[28/4/19, 2:08:05 PM] Yi Kai: It's half memory half understanding
[28/4/19, 2:08:10 PM] Yi Kai: Physics mostly understanding
[28/4/19, 2:08:20 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: idk tbh
[28/4/19, 2:08:59 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: when's sjpo
[28/4/19, 2:10:23 PM] Yi Kai: I don't know
[28/4/19, 2:10:28 PM] Yi Kai: I dao physics already lol
[28/4/19, 2:10:33 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: watt
[28/4/19, 2:10:39 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: do u attend the lessons
[28/4/19, 2:11:12 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: tbh the chem o lessons are kind of useless
[28/4/19, 2:11:26 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i dont understand anything there then i just go home and read the notes
[28/4/19, 2:11:27 PM] Yi Kai: I lazy go liao these days
[28/4/19, 2:11:35 PM] Yi Kai: Then just read the notes there
[28/4/19, 2:11:36 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: lol cus its on a saturday right
[28/4/19, 2:11:52 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: next 2 weeks is just mcq test
[28/4/19, 2:14:33 PM] Yi Kai: Yah
[28/4/19, 2:14:52 PM] Yi Kai: Plus sat morning, transport 2 hours just for 2 hours
[28/4/19, 2:15:09 PM] Yi Kai: At least NOI is more interesting, plus I know more people, plus it's more worth (since whole day)
[28/4/19, 2:57:44 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: hmm
[28/4/19, 2:57:51 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i need to finish my hw first though
[28/4/19, 3:00:12 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: what does an ac current do to a solenoid
[28/4/19, 3:01:36 PM] Yi Kai: The direction keeps switching
[28/4/19, 3:01:47 PM] Yi Kai: Brandon asked me the other day during self-study and Kai Xuan showed his answer so yah
[28/4/19, 3:02:13 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: but then BC is still a magnet right
[28/4/19, 3:02:19 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: so it keeps repelling and attracting bc
[28/4/19, 3:02:40 PM] Yi Kai: No
[28/4/19, 3:02:44 PM] Yi Kai: BC is an iron armature
[28/4/19, 3:02:53 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ya
[28/4/19, 3:03:11 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: doesnt current pass through it electromagnetiding it
[28/4/19, 3:03:45 PM] Yi Kai: It's not coiled
[28/4/19, 3:03:57 PM] Yi Kai: Think too much liao
[28/4/19, 3:03:58 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: huhh
[28/4/19, 3:04:04 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: theres still a magnetic field what
[28/4/19, 3:04:12 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: like the wire and compass experiment
[28/4/19, 3:04:16 PM] Yi Kai: It's damn weak
[28/4/19, 3:04:42 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: wth
[28/4/19, 3:05:01 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: so u can assume its practically just a magnetical material
[28/4/19, 3:06:39 PM] Yi Kai: Yah
[28/4/19, 3:09:51 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: magnetical
[28/4/19, 3:09:51 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: lol
[28/4/19, 3:09:53 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ok thanks
[28/4/19, 3:27:10 PM] Yi Kai: Wah lao this is damn triggering siah
[28/4/19, 3:27:16 PM] Yi Kai: I'm doing computing problems
[28/4/19, 3:27:28 PM] Yi Kai: And cause of one wrong output, I'm constantly getting 1/100
[28/4/19, 4:35:56 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: lol
[28/4/19, 4:36:01 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i thought u can check the code
[28/4/19, 4:39:46 PM] Yi Kai: I don't know what's wrong
[28/4/19, 4:39:51 PM] Yi Kai: I don't know what's the input
[28/4/19, 4:48:05 PM] Yi Kai: I probably still can’t do a pull-up, but at least I can do 20+ legit pushups now
[28/4/19, 4:54:18 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: actually idek if my pullup was legit
[28/4/19, 4:54:32 PM] Yi Kai: Can you usually do it?
[28/4/19, 4:54:51 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: usually i hang there for like 5 seconds first
[28/4/19, 4:55:08 PM] Yi Kai: What for
[28/4/19, 4:55:09 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: but that time i went up immediately after i stepped off the thing
[28/4/19, 4:55:13 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: idk lol
[28/4/19, 4:55:15 PM] Yi Kai: ...
[28/4/19, 4:55:24 PM] Yi Kai: Did you jump?
[28/4/19, 4:55:30 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i cant jump
[28/4/19, 4:56:02 PM] Yi Kai: Oh you use the taller one?
[28/4/19, 4:56:10 PM] Yi Kai: Anyway as Long as you didn’t it’s fine
[28/4/19, 4:56:11 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i forgot alr
[28/4/19, 4:56:34 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: if i wanna get a silver i must do 3 pullups for the retest in term 2
[28/4/19, 4:56:35 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: 3
[28/4/19, 4:56:45 PM] Yi Kai: Lol
[28/4/19, 4:56:51 PM] Yi Kai: I can't even shuttle run
[28/4/19, 4:56:51 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: which is like impossible
[28/4/19, 4:56:58 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: what did u run
[28/4/19, 4:57:01 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: how long
[28/4/19, 5:05:32 PM] Yi Kai: 11.2s
[28/4/19, 5:14:47 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oh
[28/4/19, 5:15:11 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: all the stuff they are testing now are like irrelevant for ns ippt anyways
[28/4/19, 5:15:24 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ns ippt is like pushups situps and run
[28/4/19, 5:19:10 PM] Yi Kai: Oh
[28/4/19, 5:19:22 PM] Yi Kai: IPPT before napfa?
[28/4/19, 5:19:30 PM] Yi Kai: I mean before NS? like in J2 or what
[28/4/19, 5:19:36 PM] Yi Kai: And run meaning the stamina one right
[28/4/19, 5:25:12 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: idk actually
[28/4/19, 5:25:22 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: does the napfa in j2 determine ur time in ns
[28/4/19, 5:30:24 PM] Yi Kai: I don’t know

[28/4/19, 6:45:54 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: but theres a limit to the number of dots u can put right
[28/4/19, 6:55:31 PM] Yi Kai: No
[28/4/19, 6:55:36 PM] Yi Kai: I can spam it
[28/4/19, 6:55:41 PM] Yi Kai: Or change to +
[28/4/19, 6:56:20 PM] Yi Kai: Anyway the number of possibilities(combinations) by just putting . and + in between the username already has a few 1000
[28/4/19, 7:55:06 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oh
[28/4/19, 7:55:41 PM] Yi Kai: So I’m thinking about creating accounts with this trick with just 1 email address
[28/4/19, 7:55:43 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: bleh
[28/4/19, 7:56:03 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: have u done anyth else
[28/4/19, 7:56:06 PM] Yi Kai: But may need to take precautions, I saw websites say change device id, no idea what’s that
[28/4/19, 7:56:08 PM] Yi Kai: ?

[30/4/19, 5:22:08 PM] Yi Kai: Should’ve offered draw
[30/4/19, 5:22:14 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: lol
[30/4/19, 5:22:19 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: why u blunder ur queen
[30/4/19, 5:22:23 PM] Yi Kai: Anyway doesn’t matter
[30/4/19, 5:22:36 PM] Yi Kai: I had nowhere to go when your knight went at it
[30/4/19, 5:28:48 PM] Yi Kai: Were you lagging?
[30/4/19, 5:29:07 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i reached bukit panjang alr
[30/4/19, 5:29:09 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: yeah
[30/4/19, 5:29:14 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: it wasnt supposed to lag at bukit panjang
[30/4/19, 5:29:17 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: play next time
[30/4/19, 5:29:31 PM] Yi Kai: Ok
[30/4/19, 7:50:02 PM] Yi Kai: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVPEP_KSldA
[30/4/19, 7:50:13 PM] Yi Kai: Um... excuse me
[30/4/19, 7:50:59 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: wat
[30/4/19, 7:52:53 PM] Yi Kai: It's a reference
[30/4/19, 7:58:16 PM] Yi Kai: This is from 17.3 right?
[30/4/19, 8:06:10 PM] Yi Kai: Wait this is 17.3

But then q17 is hidden though
[30/4/19, 8:07:31 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ok wait
‎[30/4/19, 8:07:46 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ‎image omitted
[30/4/19, 8:08:01 PM] Yi Kai: Ok thanks
[2/5/19, 7:20:19 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: if you subsidise cost of basic necessities, it means that purchasing power of citizens increase
[2/5/19, 7:21:10 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: so they wont need to bargain for higher wages and hence production cost wont increase and hence companies dont need to reduce supply or raise prices, hence reduced inflation
[2/5/19, 7:21:17 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: what other effects does this have
[2/5/19, 7:42:44 PM] Yi Kai: That one don’t need to care about AS and AD
[2/5/19, 7:42:57 PM] Yi Kai: It directly reduces the cost to counter inflation
[2/5/19, 7:44:22 PM] Yi Kai: But then this affects the balance so there’ll be a need for rationing measures, which is not popular

Also result in black markets, so more resources also needed to be spent to mitigate them
[2/5/19, 7:53:00 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: siao
[2/5/19, 7:53:02 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: memorise alr
[2/5/19, 7:53:09 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: thats what i wrote on my paper
‎[2/5/19, 8:05:33 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ‎image omitted
[2/5/19, 8:05:46 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: why when u run out of reserves er will decrease
[2/5/19, 8:15:10 PM] Yi Kai: I just read through and remember instantly
[2/5/19, 8:16:40 PM] Yi Kai: From what I understand right, the value of an economy's currency depends on how much actual money the economy has(which means it excludes the stuff used in foreign investments & reserves).

So when you have less money, your currency devalues again, so your ER decreases
[2/5/19, 8:16:57 PM] Yi Kai: I feel so screwed for 1st class siah
[2/5/19, 8:23:18 PM] Yi Kai: Actually only need to remember how they work, 'cause they'll kinda give you the stuff right
[2/5/19, 8:39:48 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: but why when u have more money er will increase
[2/5/19, 8:40:08 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: yeah u just need to mug the policies i guess
[2/5/19, 8:40:20 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: did u memorise muster prade alr
[2/5/19, 8:40:37 PM] Yi Kai: Cause you have more money in your economy
[2/5/19, 8:40:41 PM] Yi Kai: Not yet
[2/5/19, 8:40:43 PM] Yi Kai: Doing now
[2/5/19, 8:40:47 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: then

[2/5/19, 8:41:02 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: probably dont need to know
[2/5/19, 8:41:59 PM] Yi Kai: if the central bank simply buys foreign exchange from local firms or households in exchange for domestic currency, that will increase the monetary base and money supply, causing the exchange rate to depreciate against the foreign currency. Meanwhile, the increase in the money supply will stimulate the domestic economy and, in many cases, create pressure for an increase in the price level over and above that caused by the initial depreciation of the currency. This form of intervention in the foreign exchange market is called unsterilized intervention.

[12/5/19, 12:41:19 PM] Yi Kai: But he's often retarded if you ask me. He was the one who told me to tell stories during debate after all, and get minimum marks
[12/5/19, 12:41:28 PM] Yi Kai: Leaving early*, instead of just daoing
[12/5/19, 12:41:42 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oh

[12/5/19, 1:57:38 PM] Yi Kai: The hard part about getting excused for such things is answering this question
[12/5/19, 1:57:46 PM] Yi Kai: Cause the answer is almost no one
[12/5/19, 1:57:55 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: is zhiheng going
[12/5/19, 1:58:01 PM] Yi Kai: No
[12/5/19, 1:58:05 PM] Yi Kai: He got bronze
[12/5/19, 1:58:14 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oh
[12/5/19, 1:58:14 PM] Yi Kai: They usually select gold and silver for APIO
[12/5/19, 1:58:25 PM] Yi Kai: But this year they restrict domain to TOP 30
[12/5/19, 1:58:33 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: even if its just u it doesnt matter what
[12/5/19, 1:58:39 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: wth
[12/5/19, 1:58:47 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: thats so little
[12/5/19, 1:58:49 PM] Yi Kai: And like “if you don’t want go please tell me, it’ll help to reduce the number of SG contestants with 0 score”
[12/5/19, 1:58:59 PM] Yi Kai: There’s only 8 gold, 20+ silver
[12/5/19, 1:59:16 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: LOL
[12/5/19, 1:59:20 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: 0 score
[12/5/19, 1:59:26 PM] Yi Kai: Hi to bcc lists of 30 students = 4 Singaporeans who were already banned from NOI 2019 but still eligible for IOI 2019 + 15 NOI 2019 gold medalists + top 11 out of 29 NOI 2019 silver medalists
[12/5/19, 1:59:33 PM] Yi Kai: It’s not hard to get
[12/5/19, 2:00:26 PM] Yi Kai: NOI bans the TOP 4 every year to give others a chance to get the awards. Meaning can still do the questions for selection for other stuff, but cannot get medal
[12/5/19, 2:00:27 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: is it if u screw up one line the whole code is screwed up
[12/5/19, 2:00:32 PM] Yi Kai: Yes
[12/5/19, 2:00:37 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oh dear
[12/5/19, 2:00:54 PM] Yi Kai: But most NOI people face difficulty in thinking how to do it
[12/5/19, 2:00:58 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: thats good what
[12/5/19, 2:00:59 PM] Yi Kai: And not how to code
[12/5/19, 2:01:03 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: considering theres not much people
[12/5/19, 2:01:06 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: anyways

[16/5/19, 2:47:48 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: 5) New rule for this year: There will be negative marking imposed on the General Round. This means that guessing an answer may be damaging to your overall score. You may still guess if you can eliminate 3 out of the 5 given options. If you are totally unsure of an answer, it is better to leave the option blank. (A simple probability calculation can show that a random guess will result in a negative mark.)
[16/5/19, 2:47:50 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: lol

[18/5/19, 8:05:03 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: its bs
[18/5/19, 8:05:12 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i tried to rng and got it wrong
[18/5/19, 8:05:17 PM] Yi Kai: Lol
[18/5/19, 8:05:34 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: now i v scared the cut off point too high
[18/5/19, 8:05:51 PM] Yi Kai: Actually by probability wouldn’t rng be equally likely to help or to deduct your marks
[18/5/19, 8:06:00 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: why
[18/5/19, 8:06:10 PM] Yi Kai: 5 options
[18/5/19, 8:06:14 PM] Yi Kai: Correct 2 marks
[18/5/19, 8:06:17 PM] Yi Kai: Wrong -0.5
[18/5/19, 8:06:23 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: the risk is minusing 0.5 mark and the reward is plus 2 marks
[18/5/19, 8:06:26 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: its 4 options
[18/5/19, 8:06:33 PM] Yi Kai: Every 5 options, 1 correct 4 wrong, net gain 0
[18/5/19, 8:06:36 PM] Yi Kai: Even better
[18/5/19, 8:06:44 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: so net gain 0.5
[18/5/19, 8:06:46 PM] Yi Kai: 1 correct 3 wrong
[18/5/19, 8:06:49 PM] Yi Kai: Exactly
[18/5/19, 8:06:57 PM] Yi Kai: Then it doesn’t serve the purpose of deterrence
[18/5/19, 8:07:14 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: but if u do it ull get damn low anyways
[18/5/19, 8:07:32 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: meanwhile sjpo deduct 1 mark
[18/5/19, 8:07:37 PM] Yi Kai: Yah
[18/5/19, 8:07:53 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i didnt answer 3 questions tho
[18/5/19, 8:08:13 PM] Yi Kai: I mean like more than 4 questions that I can’t do I definitely will guess
[18/5/19, 8:08:42 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: some questions i just find some way to eliminate some answers and choose the answer that makes most sense
[18/5/19, 8:08:50 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: which is rng in some way anyways
[18/5/19, 8:09:02 PM] Yi Kai: That’s what I do for physics
[18/5/19, 8:09:07 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: lol
[18/5/19, 8:09:10 PM] Yi Kai: I bs calculate then take the closest one
[18/5/19, 8:09:27 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i tried doing that for the q50
[18/5/19, 8:09:50 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: and then i found the correct answer which is like the furthest answer from my calculated value
[18/5/19, 8:09:51 PM] Yi Kai: Wow
[18/5/19, 8:09:58 PM] Yi Kai: ...
[18/5/19, 8:10:05 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: basically they give u concentration of helium in the atomsphere
[18/5/19, 8:10:24 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: and they give u total volume of the atmosphere
[18/5/19, 8:11:01 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: and they say an "eccentric dreamer" wants to fill up spherical balloons of radius 14cm with all the helium gas on earth
[18/5/19, 8:11:25 PM] Yi Kai: Wow
[18/5/19, 8:11:30 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: then they ask how many balloons can be filled up
[18/5/19, 8:11:31 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: lol
[18/5/19, 8:11:40 PM] Yi Kai: What the
[18/5/19, 8:11:52 PM] Yi Kai: Any concentrations given?
[18/5/19, 8:11:55 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ure supposed to use PV = nrt
[18/5/19, 8:12:04 PM] Yi Kai: Anyway helium is 1 percent of atmospheric air?
[18/5/19, 8:12:10 PM] Yi Kai: Wait nvm
[18/5/19, 8:12:13 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: 0.916mg m-3 of helium is in the atmosphere
[18/5/19, 8:12:22 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: around there
[18/5/19, 8:12:29 PM] Yi Kai: How to calculate pressure in balloon
[18/5/19, 8:12:37 PM] Yi Kai: They don't expect you to estimate right
[18/5/19, 8:12:40 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: they said rtp
[18/5/19, 8:12:43 PM] Yi Kai: 'Cause balloon will squeeze it in
[18/5/19, 8:12:46 PM] Yi Kai: Oh
[18/5/19, 8:12:59 PM] Yi Kai: How many m3 is the atmosphere lmao
[18/5/19, 8:13:13 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i had 15 mins left and i was at q48 but i didnt shade in my answers yet
[18/5/19, 8:13:28 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: so i ditched q49 and 50 and i came back at like 5 mins left
[18/5/19, 8:13:41 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: then it turns out 49 and 50 was easy
[18/5/19, 8:13:51 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: so basically i almost scammed myself of 4 marks
[18/5/19, 8:14:01 PM] Yi Kai: wow
[18/5/19, 8:14:10 PM] Yi Kai: Shouldn't you do one question and shade immediately
[18/5/19, 8:14:51 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i thought it was too mafan
[18/5/19, 8:15:36 PM] Yi Kai: ...
[18/5/19, 8:15:49 PM] Yi Kai: I should probably start doing my tuition homework
[18/5/19, 8:15:58 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i havent started on homework
[18/5/19, 8:16:06 PM] Yi Kai: It's the last 2 comprehensions of a 试卷
[18/5/19, 8:16:12 PM] Yi Kai: And she said do as much as you can
[18/5/19, 8:16:14 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oh
[18/5/19, 8:16:20 PM] Yi Kai: Next one due is math AS
[18/5/19, 8:16:29 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: and el aq for me
[18/5/19, 8:16:35 PM] Yi Kai: But I'll ament open house slides first
[18/5/19, 8:16:50 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: add more ariana grande references
[18/5/19, 8:16:53 PM] Yi Kai: Shut yourself from your phone and stuff and time yourself 1h 15 mins, will finish one
[18/5/19, 8:17:00 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: almost is never enough
[18/5/19, 8:17:00 PM] Yi Kai: Idw tanck to screw me over
[18/5/19, 8:17:09 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: true
[18/5/19, 8:17:12 PM] Yi Kai: Where to add
[18/5/19, 8:17:28 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: but if i shut my phone off for like 2 days i probably can finish all the hw
[18/5/19, 8:17:37 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: even 1 day
[18/5/19, 8:17:46 PM] Yi Kai: I mean I was a bit surprised he'd recognise ari

And the other day when I walked into the lab to meet him, his spotify was open although I didn't see what was there
[18/5/19, 8:17:54 PM] Yi Kai: Definitely
[18/5/19, 8:17:58 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: loll
[18/5/19, 8:18:04 PM] Yi Kai: But SLF is harder cause com access is a must
[18/5/19, 8:18:09 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: but its not realistic
[18/5/19, 8:18:31 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: we should probably do ses during sabbat week
[18/5/19, 8:18:43 PM] Yi Kai: Right...
[18/5/19, 8:18:57 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: we wont be able to meet him
[18/5/19, 8:18:59 PM] Yi Kai: Is there that much to teach that it'll take 1 hour though
[18/5/19, 8:19:02 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: unless we go back during holidays
[18/5/19, 8:19:08 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: u scam it
[18/5/19, 8:19:11 PM] Yi Kai: Not gonna happen
[18/5/19, 8:19:18 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: u can let them watch videos or give worksheets or give kahoots
[18/5/19, 8:19:25 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: hey
[18/5/19, 8:19:40 PM] Yi Kai: a commute to and back home takes 2 hours. I'm not going to school just for <30 minutes for a meeting
[18/5/19, 8:19:56 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ure coming for spring cleaning right
[18/5/19, 8:19:59 PM] Yi Kai: So during POP atr I was damn triggered at fux
[18/5/19, 8:20:03 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: its on 7 june now
[18/5/19, 8:20:05 PM] Yi Kai: Me and gl not coming
[18/5/19, 8:20:18 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: they changed it because of slc
[18/5/19, 8:20:17 PM] Yi Kai: We gonna say we have DSO cryptography module
[18/5/19, 8:20:21 PM] Yi Kai: Which is actual
[18/5/19, 8:20:23 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: which is retarded but ok
[18/5/19, 8:20:26 PM] Yi Kai: Oh
[18/5/19, 8:20:27 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: huh
[18/5/19, 8:20:34 PM] Yi Kai: 'Cause we under defence science
[18/5/19, 8:20:43 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i wanna go
[18/5/19, 8:20:44 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: so fun
[18/5/19, 8:20:49 PM] Yi Kai: Then we went for this DSO World of Science cryptography module
[18/5/19, 8:20:55 PM] Yi Kai: Last year I went for computer security
[18/5/19, 8:21:01 PM] Yi Kai: Can use to pon one
[18/5/19, 8:21:06 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: lol
[18/5/19, 8:21:17 PM] Yi Kai: In fact last year I used it to pon the last training. But I don't think they'll allow this time 'cause it's CAPE
[18/5/19, 8:21:41 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: u mean it actually falls on the last training
[18/5/19, 8:21:44 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: or was it a scam
[18/5/19, 8:22:56 PM] Yi Kai: The briefing falls on last training
[18/5/19, 8:23:08 PM] Yi Kai: And since zhouxuan used it to pon, so I just do the same lorh
[18/5/19, 8:31:30 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oh
[18/5/19, 8:31:35 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: what a scam
[18/5/19, 9:14:29 PM] Yi Kai: By the way, is it true that Ng posted a SLF guide
[18/5/19, 9:14:31 PM] Yi Kai: Where's it ah
[18/5/19, 9:15:47 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: wait what
[18/5/19, 9:15:48 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: where
[18/5/19, 9:16:37 PM] Yi Kai: I don't know
[18/5/19, 9:51:36 PM] Yi Kai: Wait nvm it's on google classroom for form class
[18/5/19, 9:57:03 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oh lol
[18/5/19, 9:57:11 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: what guide
[18/5/19, 9:57:18 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: is it the questions she sent last year for slf too
[18/5/19, 9:57:46 PM] Yi Kai: Maybe, seems different
[18/5/19, 9:57:52 PM] Yi Kai: I don't remember what she sent last year liao
[18/5/19, 9:58:03 PM] Yi Kai: How regularly you try doing pull-ups one
[18/5/19, 9:58:19 PM] Yi Kai: I keep trying to not care about it but it has to be done eventually
[18/5/19, 9:58:51 PM] Yi Kai: how to answer

3. How have I use my strengths and passion in service to others?

[18/5/19, 10:02:04 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oh
[18/5/19, 10:02:11 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i also want do pullups
[18/5/19, 10:02:26 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: u need silver to get less ns right
[18/5/19, 10:02:28 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: in jc2
[18/5/19, 10:04:01 PM] Yi Kai: Yes
[18/5/19, 10:04:21 PM] Yi Kai: Anyway the due date for PE is when ah? I haven't decided
[18/5/19, 10:05:57 PM] Yi Kai: Nvm it's Monday
[18/5/19, 10:05:58 PM] Yi Kai: Cao
[18/5/19, 10:06:09 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ya
[18/5/19, 10:06:16 PM] Yi Kai: I should probs bring a chair there to assist for me
[18/5/19, 10:06:25 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: pullups?
[18/5/19, 10:06:55 PM] Yi Kai: Yah
[18/5/19, 10:09:23 PM] Yi Kai: 'Cause among all the things I see, the most common ones are inclined pull-ups(which doing with table is damn scary) and assisted.

Only Yuxing recommends doing it reverse
[18/5/19, 10:10:45 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: whats reverse
[18/5/19, 10:15:58 PM] Yi Kai: He say you jump all the way up then try to hold it up there as long as possible
[18/5/19, 10:20:39 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oh
[18/5/19, 10:20:49 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: thats what some people say
[18/5/19, 10:21:51 PM] Yi Kai: I can hold there for like 2-3 seconds
[18/5/19, 11:54:55 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: wait what
[18/5/19, 11:55:00 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: that seems like a long time
[19/5/19, 8:23:33 AM] Yi Kai: As in while I slowly drop
[19/5/19, 10:43:10 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oh
[20/5/19, 3:13:19 PM] Yi Kai: I've been trying to do my SLF for the past hour
[20/5/19, 3:13:24 PM] Yi Kai: And after this hour, I haven't started
[20/5/19, 3:13:36 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i havent done anything for the past 2 days
[20/5/19, 3:13:45 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: so ure fine
[20/5/19, 3:23:58 PM] Yi Kai: I have been doing stuff 'cause I had competition
[20/5/19, 3:24:05 PM] Yi Kai: And 'cause my parents bring me out to town
[20/5/19, 3:24:12 PM] Yi Kai: And 'cause I did the math assignment
[20/5/19, 3:24:20 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: but i havent done any hw yet
[20/5/19, 3:24:22 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: cus of chem o
[20/5/19, 3:24:42 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: how does the integration ws work
[20/5/19, 3:24:50 PM] Yi Kai: So you were mugging chem o for the whole week
[20/5/19, 3:24:57 PM] Yi Kai: Whcih one
[20/5/19, 3:25:02 PM] Yi Kai: Substitution?
[20/5/19, 3:26:32 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: yes
[20/5/19, 3:26:35 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: and idek if i can get in
[20/5/19, 3:26:36 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ya
[20/5/19, 3:27:21 PM] Yi Kai: Lol
[20/5/19, 3:27:26 PM] Yi Kai: I sent a link earlier on right...
[20/5/19, 3:27:41 PM] Yi Kai: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMHnd6X35rI
[20/5/19, 3:29:18 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: as in the 1st page
[20/5/19, 3:29:22 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: how do uk what to substitute
[20/5/19, 3:33:11 PM] Yi Kai: That one I don’t know how
[20/5/19, 3:33:38 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: its damn cancer
[20/5/19, 3:33:49 PM] Yi Kai: The rest I either Google the question (so I can find the steps) or I just integral calculator
[20/5/19, 3:33:52 PM] Yi Kai: Agreed
[20/5/19, 3:33:57 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: lol
[20/5/19, 3:34:07 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i think im presenting 1st page
[20/5/19, 3:34:15 PM] Yi Kai: You good
[20/5/19, 3:34:19 PM] Yi Kai: Just anyhow do
[20/5/19, 3:35:02 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: then he flame me
[20/5/19, 3:46:53 PM] Yi Kai: I don't know
[20/5/19, 3:47:12 PM] Yi Kai: You remind me of dong jun when you say that
[20/5/19, 3:47:45 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: lol
[20/5/19, 3:47:53 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: hshdhdhdh
[20/5/19, 3:48:09 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: we only have lessons on monday tues and fri next week right
[20/5/19, 3:55:36 PM] Yi Kai: Yes
[20/5/19, 5:17:41 PM] Yi Kai: I'm playing a 5 min game on another account
[20/5/19, 5:17:47 PM] Yi Kai: And my opponent is 1 move from winning
[20/5/19, 5:17:53 PM] Yi Kai: But I think he afked
[20/5/19, 5:18:01 PM] Yi Kai: Or he's bming
[20/5/19, 5:18:35 PM] Yi Kai: Which he is, he did it in the last second lol
[20/5/19, 5:20:48 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: loll
[20/5/19, 5:20:51 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: probably bm
[20/5/19, 5:21:00 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: toxic
[20/5/19, 5:21:13 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: what if u wait till the last second to resign
[20/5/19, 5:23:55 PM] Yi Kai: Yes
[20/5/19, 5:24:01 PM] Yi Kai: Hmm
[20/5/19, 5:24:18 PM] Yi Kai: I was actually kinda hoping he afked and wondered if I should offer a draw
[20/5/19, 5:24:47 PM] Yi Kai: But it's mainly 'cause that account elo was 1200+ and my actual blitz rating is a bit less than 1100
[20/5/19, 5:25:11 PM] Yi Kai: When I saw my opponent elo I was like why his elo so high
[20/5/19, 5:28:27 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: blitz is 3 min right
[20/5/19, 5:33:04 PM] Yi Kai: 3 or 5
[20/5/19, 5:33:08 PM] Yi Kai: On com I play 5
[20/5/19, 5:33:15 PM] Yi Kai: 'Cause com can't really rush the last few seconds
[20/5/19, 5:33:36 PM] Yi Kai: Do you play puzzles/puzzle rush
[20/5/19, 5:33:47 PM] Yi Kai: It's the main thing that helps me improve
[20/5/19, 5:33:49 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: idh
[20/5/19, 5:34:55 PM] Yi Kai: Wdym
[20/5/19, 5:34:56 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i only got like 5 daily puzzles

[20/5/19, 5:35:03 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: wth
[20/5/19, 5:35:07 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: wait lemme go find
[20/5/19, 5:35:07 PM] Yi Kai: Same, I have 3 accounts for it
[20/5/19, 5:35:15 PM] Yi Kai: On the website definitely have
[20/5/19, 5:36:39 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: mine cfm dont have
[20/5/19, 5:36:51 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: the only thing similar to tactics which i alr cleared
[20/5/19, 5:50:27 PM] Yi Kai: Oh
[20/5/19, 5:50:30 PM] Yi Kai: The website has
[20/5/19, 5:57:04 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: how do u play on comp its so mafan to move the cursor

[28/5/19, 6:50:40 AM] Yi Kai: When I finally had a win streak yesterday night my parents were like you’re playing too much chess, shouldn’t play more than 5 games a day
[28/5/19, 6:52:21 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: lol
[28/5/19, 6:52:26 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: but 5 games is 10 mins
[28/5/19, 6:55:32 AM] Yi Kai: That’s the thing
[28/5/19, 6:55:55 AM] Yi Kai: He probably has an impression I play 3 minute games or something
[28/5/19, 6:56:24 AM] Yi Kai: But his suggested limits are usually damn tight, like my WhatsApp isn’t used more than 20 minute per day usually

I created an astroparty bot and let it play against itself to learn, then I was "wow that's so OP already"

Then when I play against it I beat it like 15-5
[20/6/19, 4:52:04 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: how does it learn
[20/6/19, 4:52:12 PM] Yi Kai: I just googled like siao
[20/6/19, 4:52:16 PM] Yi Kai: then copy paste AI code lmao
[20/6/19, 4:52:24 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: cool
[20/6/19, 4:52:32 PM] Yi Kai: Like at each point in time, it checks if turning/shooting increases the chances of winning
[20/6/19, 4:52:42 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: is it if u let it lesrn longer it will get better
[20/6/19, 4:52:49 PM] Yi Kai: Supposedly

[20/6/19, 4:53:35 PM] Yi Kai: Yah
[20/6/19, 4:53:46 PM] Yi Kai: Only problem is if both players decide to camp
[20/6/19, 4:53:55 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: did it happen
[20/6/19, 4:53:58 PM] Yi Kai: Then the positions don't change, and they just stay still
[20/6/19, 4:54:01 PM] Yi Kai: Yah
[20/6/19, 4:54:05 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: does the robot camp
[20/6/19, 4:54:05 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: lol
[20/6/19, 4:54:14 PM] Yi Kai: Then usually if I make a player dash out, the player that dashes out wins
[20/6/19, 4:54:19 PM] Yi Kai: Sometimes
[20/6/19, 4:54:36 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: hmm
[20/6/19, 4:54:58 PM] Yi Kai: It's damn good at dodging bullets
[20/6/19, 4:55:03 PM] Yi Kai: But not good at shooting

[22/6/19, 6:37:54 PM] Yi Kai: As in how to input it or whát
[22/6/19, 6:38:23 PM] Yi Kai: It's essentially a guide to how to read the "what" 'cause it can have diff meanings
[22/6/19, 6:38:25 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: what do they test
[22/6/19, 6:38:38 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: whát
[22/6/19, 6:38:50 PM] Yi Kai: Similar to what the actual competition tests
[22/6/19, 6:38:55 PM] Yi Kai: Just the format a bit different
[22/6/19, 6:38:59 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oh
[22/6/19, 6:39:08 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: its depressing to be back in sh
[22/6/19, 6:39:09 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: sg
[22/6/19, 6:39:16 PM] Yi Kai: For coding, as long as same subject, everything not too much difference one, just the difficulty can differ
[22/6/19, 6:39:20 PM] Yi Kai: Why?
[22/6/19, 6:39:24 PM] Yi Kai: China also v warm now righ
[22/6/19, 6:39:29 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ya
[22/6/19, 6:39:34 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: cus of all the work
[22/6/19, 6:39:50 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: slaxking for 3+ weeks and squeezing everything into the last week
[22/6/19, 6:39:56 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: seems like a logical decision
[22/6/19, 6:40:17 PM] Yi Kai: What's there that's so pressuring
[22/6/19, 6:40:20 PM] Yi Kai: Other than SES and pw
[22/6/19, 6:40:26 PM] Yi Kai: Oh yah chinese Ct
[22/6/19, 6:40:39 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: math ws chem ws
[22/6/19, 6:40:45 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i didnt do
[22/6/19, 6:40:46 PM] Yi Kai: Probably mug during pw evaluation when everyone around me damn good at chinese
[22/6/19, 6:40:51 PM] Yi Kai: Not long one what
[22/6/19, 6:40:52 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i guess chem should be easy
[22/6/19, 6:40:58 PM] Yi Kai: Chinese have what ah, actually
[22/6/19, 6:41:07 PM] Yi Kai: Quite a few qns I don't know how to do, left blank
[22/6/19, 6:41:15 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: idk cus im not planning to do
[22/6/19, 6:41:25 PM] Yi Kai: ...
[22/6/19, 6:41:29 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: its just the piece of paper right
[22/6/19, 6:41:39 PM] Yi Kai: I feel bad when I look at all my blank worksheets and activity book in s3
[22/6/19, 6:41:47 PM] Yi Kai: Which lists a heck load of stuff
[22/6/19, 6:42:19 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: LOL
[22/6/19, 6:42:26 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: s3 i was damn mugger for chinese
[22/6/19, 6:42:35 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: back when i actuslly listened in chinese lesson
[22/6/19, 6:42:41 PM] Yi Kai: You're so damn good at chinese...
[22/6/19, 6:42:49 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: no lor wth
[22/6/19, 6:42:55 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i got 24 for oral
[22/6/19, 6:43:23 PM] Yi Kai: Wot legit
[22/6/19, 6:43:29 PM] Yi Kai: I got 26 and I was sulking hard
[22/6/19, 6:43:48 PM] Yi Kai: 'Cause last year I got 30. I could blame my examiner, but both guan lin and tyler got 28
[22/6/19, 6:43:58 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: omg what
[22/6/19, 6:44:02 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i got 29
[22/6/19, 6:44:05 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: yeah
[22/6/19, 6:44:13 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: im at the bottom with keith
[22/6/19, 6:44:28 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: chinese is not a v important subject anyways
[22/6/19, 6:44:27 PM] Yi Kai: Then the thing is I'm lazy to go remedial
[22/6/19, 6:44:44 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: just get enough to not do it in jc
[22/6/19, 6:45:00 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: does msg even matter
[22/6/19, 6:45:45 PM] Yi Kai: True, but if I do nothing I just get b4 all the time, exact
[22/6/19, 6:45:58 PM] Yi Kai: So my parents keep saying I need to study more to not take it in jc
[22/6/19, 6:46:30 PM] Yi Kai: In sec 2, I once thought through the whole thing, and knew that every subject other than English is A1-able ('cause my S1 msg was 2-2.5)
[22/6/19, 6:47:05 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: english is more a1able now than in s1 and 2
[22/6/19, 6:47:15 PM] Yi Kai: Really meh...
[22/6/19, 6:47:29 PM] Yi Kai: Ok maybe 'cause every time in a test they make it much easier
[22/6/19, 6:47:35 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ya what
[22/6/19, 6:47:38 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: guan lin got a1
[22/6/19, 6:47:39 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: for eou
[22/6/19, 6:47:40 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: eoy
[22/6/19, 6:48:03 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: actually it kinda is based on ur luck
[22/6/19, 6:48:06 PM] Yi Kai: And you got exempted...
[22/6/19, 6:48:11 PM] Yi Kai: Why? for essay?
[22/6/19, 6:48:13 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: no i didnt
[22/6/19, 6:48:22 PM] Yi Kai: No meh?
[22/6/19, 6:48:28 PM] Yi Kai: I thought jennywong say you exempted
[22/6/19, 6:48:34 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: im pretty sure i got exempted at first
[22/6/19, 6:48:41 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: then i told her i got 2 a2 and a1
[22/6/19, 6:48:46 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: which isnt exemption criteria
[22/6/19, 6:48:54 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: which was a stupid thing to do anyways
[22/6/19, 6:49:02 PM] Yi Kai: Lol
[22/6/19, 6:49:04 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: and then i didnt get exempted from any subject
[22/6/19, 6:49:13 PM] Yi Kai: Oh yah I forgot about that
[22/6/19, 6:49:30 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i was daydreaming and drawing stuff on my foolscap and she called me out
[22/6/19, 6:49:34 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oops
[22/6/19, 7:18:16 PM] Yi Kai: Anyway my astroparty bot is still rather trash I've run out of ideas to increase the learning rate

But if I give it way more bullets, then it'll be as good as me
[22/6/19, 7:22:43 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: thats cheating
[22/6/19, 7:23:20 PM] Yi Kai: At least it's not so easy win
[22/6/19, 7:23:22 PM] Yi Kai: So it's more fun
[22/6/19, 7:23:55 PM] Yi Kai: When it plays against itself, the chances of green winning is 60% and the other winning is 40
[22/6/19, 7:24:01 PM] Yi Kai: Like I don't get why the difference is so huge
[22/6/19, 7:24:04 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: why
[22/6/19, 7:24:04 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: lol
[22/6/19, 7:24:13 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ones smarter
[22/6/19, 7:24:18 PM] Yi Kai: 'Cause the scores are about 3:2
[23/6/19, 10:51:19 PM] Yi Kai: And throughout this time I've been trying to make an astroparty bot, a version called astro duel was released. Includes AI players + new powerups/levels/...
[23/6/19, 10:58:14 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: where
[23/6/19, 10:58:18 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: web ah
[23/6/19, 11:02:31 PM] Yi Kai: Phone don't have
[23/6/19, 11:02:37 PM] Yi Kai: Need bigger device I think
[23/6/19, 11:02:49 PM] Yi Kai: But it's not free so I have not lost motivation
[23/6/19, 11:07:09 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oh
[23/6/19, 11:09:04 PM] Yi Kai: I still remember at first my motivation to make astro was 'cause I'll use it to give myself experience in games across devices
[23/6/19, 11:09:25 PM] Yi Kai: Which I did make, but both devices need to be connected to same network to connect(since I don't have a server)
[23/6/19, 11:47:04 PM] Yi Kai: Also, I recently found out that fibre optics aren't just some useless things they test in physics: It's actually used for wifi networks, to deliver signal to homes before it's converted to wireless
[24/6/19, 10:20:17 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: huh i thought they got teach that
[24/6/19, 10:20:18 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: lol
[24/6/19, 10:26:05 AM] Yi Kai: Oh really
[24/6/19, 10:26:10 AM] Yi Kai: Never knew
[24/6/19, 11:05:51 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: bruh theres uc tmr
[24/6/19, 11:08:16 AM] Yi Kai: And?
[24/6/19, 11:08:24 AM] Yi Kai: Not like I’m going anyway
[24/6/19, 11:08:35 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: and i dont want to go
[24/6/19, 11:08:46 AM] Yi Kai: Aiyah it’s fine lah
[24/6/19, 11:08:52 AM] Yi Kai: Going as buddy was damn fun
[24/6/19, 11:09:06 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i think its gonna be a flop this year
[24/6/19, 11:09:21 AM] Yi Kai: I’m like “whoever don’t want veg give me half of yours”
[24/6/19, 11:09:22 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: they are doing everything last minute
[24/6/19, 11:09:28 AM] Yi Kai: Ain’t that normal
[24/6/19, 11:09:29 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: the games were only confirmed 2 days ago
[24/6/19, 11:09:34 AM] Yi Kai: Bruh
[24/6/19, 11:09:35 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: this isnt
[24/6/19, 11:09:55 AM] Yi Kai: Batch 49 I heard they bought the cloth for flag on the morning
[24/6/19, 11:10:09 AM] Yi Kai: And cut the cloth like 30 minutes before flag painting
[24/6/19, 11:10:11 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: lol
[24/6/19, 11:10:19 AM] Yi Kai: According to zhouxuan
[24/6/19, 11:10:34 AM] Yi Kai: Oh and by the way, don’t trust Ansel too much
[24/6/19, 11:10:45 AM] Yi Kai: He’s the kind of person who likes to play dirty one
[24/6/19, 11:10:53 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oooff
[24/6/19, 11:11:04 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: hes just a photographer
[24/6/19, 11:11:15 AM] Yi Kai: When I was buddy he was the one who suggested camping in level 3 toilet
[24/6/19, 11:11:23 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: lol
[24/6/19, 10:37:21 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: I don’t think this batch of NCOs and ExCo deserves to wear their SSG/SI ranks.



Because I don’t see anyone who actually care about how their juniors are doing. Fail? So be it. It is so easy to say, “do not be discouraged and continue to work hard for the upcoming retest”.



They are just happy to see them fail. A zero percent passing rate for Sec 3s for SSG, supposedly the best of the lot, says a lot about how they are being trained. It also says a lot about the current culture in the Unit – reflecting an ineffective training curriculum, a team of ineffective trainers, and a group of ineffective cadet leaders who’re making things worse, rather than better. This culture is sadistic – perhaps satisfying for some – to see how their juniors fail while they are ‘superior’. And then the cycle repeats for the next batch.



This is not what I envisioned. This is far from what I envisioned. This is not servant leadership at all. This is not how leaders should be.



So, to justify the poor results, all current Sec 4s will wear rank no higher than SGT with immediate effect, until further notice. No one in the Unit deserves to wear and show his SSG/SI rank – because none of them is fit to do so.
[24/6/19, 10:37:29 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: lol i pass also no diff
[24/6/19, 10:38:05 PM] Yi Kai: Maumu send one?
[24/6/19, 10:38:09 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ha
[24/6/19, 10:38:11 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ya*
[24/6/19, 10:38:16 PM] Yi Kai: Why you receive
[24/6/19, 10:38:24 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: fuxiang send me
[24/6/19, 10:38:27 PM] Yi Kai: Wow
[24/6/19, 10:38:42 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: his logic is flawed
[24/6/19, 10:38:46 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: but ok
[24/6/19, 10:38:48 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: he makes the shots
[24/6/19, 10:39:02 PM] Yi Kai: Indeed
[24/6/19, 10:39:17 PM] Yi Kai: But then it's the CIs who failed them
[24/6/19, 10:39:44 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: hes saying we are happy to see them fail
[24/6/19, 10:39:52 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: just because no one passed
[24/6/19, 10:40:16 PM] Yi Kai: Not like I'm happy to fail right...
[24/6/19, 10:40:22 PM] Yi Kai: True
[26/6/19, 1:50:31 PM] Yi Kai: Wth I just realised ansel is future pubs head

He's like snake 101/100 one wth

But then I have no authority or wtv to speak on
[26/6/19, 1:51:03 PM] Yi Kai: Plus just like how Avier became head 'cause he in ProEd council, I think ansel got in cause icouncil
[26/6/19, 1:51:49 PM] Yi Kai: Like don't tell avier, but when adriale asked if I'm fine with avier as head, I strongly objected but didn't dare to say so I just said "I'm fine but I'd rather weihan be head" 'cause if I say I want head a bit weird
[26/6/19, 2:53:51 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: hmm
[26/6/19, 2:53:59 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: why udw avier though
[26/6/19, 2:55:01 PM] Yi Kai: 'Cause my impression of him in sec 3 is like damn slack, esp 'cause he's with Ivan so I associate the both of them
[26/6/19, 3:09:13 PM] Yi Kai: Fu xiang told me I didn't fail any aspect. I failed overall by 3 mark
[26/6/19, 4:04:25 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: what abt now though
‎[26/6/19, 4:04:42 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ‎image omitted
[26/6/19, 4:09:55 PM] Yi Kai: Better
[26/6/19, 4:10:09 PM] Yi Kai: Bruh structure and bonding
[26/6/19, 4:10:35 PM] Yi Kai: Alchol
[26/6/19, 4:10:54 PM] Yi Kai: At first I thought 'cause more electrons more dispersion forces.

But I realised alcohol has hydrogen bonding
[26/6/19, 4:11:09 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: idk how explain lol
[26/6/19, 4:11:19 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: huh the alcohol is higher boiling point?
[26/6/19, 4:11:18 PM] Yi Kai: hydrogen bond
[26/6/19, 4:11:28 PM] Yi Kai: Yah
[26/6/19, 4:11:32 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: omg
[26/6/19, 4:11:36 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i thought it was lower
[26/6/19, 4:11:42 PM] Yi Kai: Stronger bond -> need omre energy to overcome -> higher boiling point
[26/6/19, 4:11:46 PM] Yi Kai: Bruh why
[26/6/19, 4:11:54 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: alcohol evaporates
[26/6/19, 4:11:58 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oh lol
[26/6/19, 4:12:08 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: this is the first question im doing in 3 weeks
[26/6/19, 4:12:30 PM] Yi Kai: ...

Water evaporates too, but it's not boiling
[26/6/19, 4:12:56 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ooos
[26/6/19, 4:12:57 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oops
[26/6/19, 4:13:04 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ok thanks lol
‎[26/6/19, 5:39:11 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ‎image omitted
[26/6/19, 5:39:19 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: and then use the ratio to find
[26/6/19, 5:42:48 PM] Yi Kai: Maybe

I don’t think I did that question cause I don’t know how to do
[26/6/19, 5:43:05 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oh
[26/6/19, 5:43:11 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: but u need it for the rest of the page though
[26/6/19, 5:47:07 PM] Yi Kai: I didn't do quite a number of questions
[26/6/19, 6:16:17 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i can't do anything
[26/6/19, 6:16:36 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: how does altering ph leads to higher rate of reaction
[26/6/19, 6:19:10 PM] Yi Kai: Send question
‎[26/6/19, 6:20:23 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ‎image omitted
[26/6/19, 6:20:57 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: then they say they use alkaline condition even though it gives a slower rate
[26/6/19, 6:22:42 PM] Yi Kai: You see part a the reaction
[26/6/19, 6:22:50 PM] Yi Kai: The result is calcium hydroxide, which is alkaline
[26/6/19, 6:23:22 PM] Yi Kai: Then in acidic conditions, the acid will react with calcium hydroxide, an exothermic reaction

So since got second reaction so rate of heating become higher
[26/6/19, 6:24:12 PM] Yi Kai: As for why they still use alkaline condition although slower rate, I don't know
[26/6/19, 6:44:03 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ohh
[26/6/19, 6:44:10 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: it sounds familiar
[26/6/19, 6:44:17 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: like sow went through nefore
[26/6/19, 6:44:21 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: but im not sure
[26/6/19, 6:45:52 PM] Yi Kai: I think I said sth like the acid may just react with the cao or something stupid
[26/6/19, 6:51:51 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: makes sense what
[26/6/19, 6:54:34 PM] Yi Kai: But that means that the rate of reaction won't increase liao
[26/6/19, 7:35:59 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: hshdjdjf
[26/6/19, 9:53:21 PM] Yi Kai: How's unit camp
[26/6/19, 9:53:28 PM] Yi Kai: What's the theme this year
[27/6/19, 2:26:56 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: avengers or marvel or smth
[27/6/19, 2:27:04 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: im like slacling
[27/6/19, 7:14:20 AM] Yi Kai: Wow
[27/6/19, 7:14:32 AM] Yi Kai: Isn’t that the point of UC CAs?
[27/6/19, 8:06:06 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: lol
[27/6/19, 8:06:10 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: which is dumb
[27/6/19, 8:42:13 AM] Yi Kai: Yah
[28/6/19, 6:09:19 PM] Yi Kai: After adding a lot of physics calculations to complement AI and allowing it to dash, it can finally win me
[28/6/19, 6:24:14 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: lol
[28/6/19, 8:05:05 PM] Yi Kai: You want do ses?
[28/6/19, 8:05:17 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i need do pw now
[28/6/19, 8:05:19 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: maybe later
[28/6/19, 8:05:21 PM] Yi Kai: Ok then dao
[28/6/19, 8:05:27 PM] Yi Kai: What's this last minute
[28/6/19, 8:05:34 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: we havent started
[28/6/19, 8:05:36 PM] Yi Kai: But tbh zhiheng was carrying for pw slides
[28/6/19, 8:05:40 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i havent done hw too
[28/6/19, 8:05:43 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oop
[28/6/19, 8:05:48 PM] Yi Kai: We finished a week ago, started at the first week of holidays
[28/6/19, 8:05:55 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: haiz
[28/6/19, 8:12:17 PM] Yi Kai: 8d audio is amazing
[28/6/19, 8:12:30 PM] Yi Kai: First hear is damn good, after that not so good but still good
[28/6/19, 8:12:44 PM] Yi Kai: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUVdwSSY0oo
[28/6/19, 8:13:16 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: lol i listen before
[28/6/19, 8:13:18 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: true
[28/6/19, 8:15:11 PM] Yi Kai: Lol
[28/6/19, 8:15:17 PM] Yi Kai: I was like what's that then yah
[28/6/19, 8:25:11 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: it feels like the music is circling around ur head
[28/6/19, 8:25:43 PM] Yi Kai: That's the point
[28/6/19, 8:25:47 PM] Yi Kai: At first it feels damn good
[28/6/19, 8:28:35 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: its very pesky to keep going to youtube to listen though

[8/7/19, 6:25:02 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: wait how to do the 1/a - 1/b question
[8/7/19, 6:30:00 PM] Yi Kai: Integration?
[8/7/19, 6:30:41 PM] Yi Kai: Have I given you the hint that RHS is basically 1/1-1/n?
[8/7/19, 6:30:51 PM] Yi Kai: Worksheet right? Not assignment
[8/7/19, 6:31:17 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ya
[8/7/19, 6:31:23 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: wait zhiheng sent me the ans alr
[8/7/19, 6:31:27 PM] Yi Kai: Lol
[8/7/19, 6:31:30 PM] Yi Kai: He copied mine
[8/7/19, 6:41:12 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: how do uk like after u express the 2 expressions in another form that the left one is smaller than the right one
[8/7/19, 6:41:42 PM] Yi Kai: Can show me what zhijrnbdrny you?
[8/7/19, 6:41:50 PM] Yi Kai: What Zhiheng sent you*
[8/7/19, 6:41:52 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: lol
[8/7/19, 6:41:54 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: zhijjennfrdny
‎[8/7/19, 6:41:58 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ‎image omitted
[8/7/19, 6:42:33 PM] Yi Kai: Ok so the expression 1/1-1/n is the area under the graph from x=1 to x=n correct?
[8/7/19, 6:42:43 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ye
[8/7/19, 6:43:05 PM] Yi Kai: Then 1/2^2 take it to be the area of the bar between x=1 and x=2
[8/7/19, 6:43:18 PM] Yi Kai: So it takes the value of the curve when x is 2
[8/7/19, 6:43:34 PM] Yi Kai: Then the width is 1
[8/7/19, 6:43:41 PM] Yi Kai: Then so on for the other bars
[8/7/19, 6:43:58 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: yes
[8/7/19, 6:44:20 PM] Yi Kai: So the 1/1-1/n as an area, includes more than the bats right?
[8/7/19, 6:44:22 PM] Yi Kai: Bars*
[8/7/19, 6:44:27 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: so its like adding like only a few sections of the graph?
[8/7/19, 6:44:34 PM] Yi Kai: Cause there’s also the parts above the bars
[8/7/19, 6:44:37 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: as in the 1/2^2 and so on
[8/7/19, 6:44:38 PM] Yi Kai: Wdym
[8/7/19, 6:44:41 PM] Yi Kai: Yah
[8/7/19, 6:44:51 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: like got a lot of space in between
[8/7/19, 6:44:55 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: eg from 4 to 9
[8/7/19, 6:45:06 PM] Yi Kai: So the area of the bar from 1 to 2 is of height 1/2^2

And the width is 1
[8/7/19, 6:45:09 PM] Yi Kai: Nonono
[8/7/19, 6:45:24 PM] Yi Kai: The bar from 2 to 3 height is 1/3^2
[8/7/19, 6:45:31 PM] Yi Kai: Cause the graph is 1/x^2
[8/7/19, 6:45:53 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oh
[8/7/19, 6:45:58 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: so its sitll connected
[8/7/19, 6:46:01 PM] Yi Kai: Yah
[8/7/19, 6:46:05 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: since x is always consecutive
[8/7/19, 6:46:07 PM] Yi Kai: Yes
[8/7/19, 6:46:13 PM] Yi Kai: ^
[8/7/19, 6:46:22 PM] Yi Kai: So 1/1-1/n is greater
[8/7/19, 6:46:30 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: wdym
[8/7/19, 6:46:41 PM] Yi Kai: Cause 1/1-1/n is the area right
[8/7/19, 6:47:08 PM] Yi Kai: So in Zhiheng’s diagram, it is the area of all the bars, PLUS the portions on TOP of the bars below the curve
[8/7/19, 6:47:32 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: but how do uk for example at x = 2 the corner of the bar doesnt start at the curve
[8/7/19, 6:47:40 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: as in the left corner
[8/7/19, 6:47:56 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: instead its the right corner which is at the curve which makes an empty space
[8/7/19, 6:47:59 PM] Yi Kai: Because of how I define them
[8/7/19, 6:48:31 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: how did u define
[8/7/19, 6:49:04 PM] Yi Kai: I mean go and calculate the area of the bars yourself in each case
[8/7/19, 6:50:39 PM] Yi Kai: Can see it?
[8/7/19, 6:52:43 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: wait wat
[8/7/19, 6:52:47 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: if i take width of bar
[8/7/19, 6:52:53 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: its 1/2^2 ×
[8/7/19, 6:52:54 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: 1
[8/7/19, 6:52:57 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: which is 1/4
[8/7/19, 6:53:08 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: but if i integrate the curve from 2 to 3 i get 1/6
[8/7/19, 6:54:40 PM] Yi Kai: This is area from 1 to 2
[8/7/19, 6:55:07 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: why
[8/7/19, 6:55:37 PM] Yi Kai: Again, it depends on how you define the bar
[8/7/19, 6:56:21 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: wdym i dun see definition anywehere
[8/7/19, 6:58:43 PM] Yi Kai: I tell you in person tomorrow
[8/7/19, 6:58:53 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ok
‎[8/7/19, 8:44:18 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ‎image omitted
[8/7/19, 8:44:43 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: if u connect in any way doesnt it always shime at normal brightness
[8/7/19, 8:45:11 PM] Yi Kai: Yes
[8/7/19, 8:45:18 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: what the
[8/7/19, 8:45:31 PM] Yi Kai: I mean like as long as it's 12V, 24W, it's normal brightness
[8/7/19, 8:45:40 PM] Yi Kai: Like must have that^
[8/7/19, 8:45:49 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: do u need to draw the transformer out
[8/7/19, 8:45:54 PM] Yi Kai: I guess
[8/7/19, 8:45:56 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: and indicate n.m of turns
[8/7/19, 8:45:58 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: no.
[8/7/19, 8:46:08 PM] Yi Kai: Yah
[8/7/19, 8:46:19 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: so u just connect the bulbs to the transformer ah
[8/7/19, 8:46:22 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: by the coil
[8/7/19, 8:46:35 PM] Yi Kai: Kind of
[8/7/19, 8:46:44 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: omg
[8/7/19, 8:46:45 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ok
[8/7/19, 9:02:02 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: how r u supposed to find the current
[8/7/19, 9:02:04 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: in the coil
[8/7/19, 10:11:50 PM] Yi Kai: Power is constant
[8/7/19, 10:11:56 PM] Yi Kai: If it's 100% efficient
[8/7/19, 10:17:22 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oh

[12/7/19, 6:07:51 AM] Yi Kai: I was going to say differentiate V but 2 variables
[12/7/19, 6:09:20 AM] Yi Kai: Question is why you Mug till 12
[12/7/19, 6:31:46 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: 2
[12/7/19, 6:31:47 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: lol
[12/7/19, 6:32:00 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: this was in some math ws
[12/7/19, 6:32:03 AM] Yi Kai: But seriously what for
[12/7/19, 6:32:11 AM] Yi Kai: Math is just sleep well and perform
[12/7/19, 6:32:25 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: for u
[12/7/19, 6:32:30 AM] Yi Kai: It’s like NOI, just that NOI gives more pressure tha needs to be overcome
[12/7/19, 6:32:31 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i dont rmb anything
[12/7/19, 6:32:43 AM] Yi Kai: You can differentiate right
[12/7/19, 6:33:01 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: questionably
[12/7/19, 6:35:17 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: u only need know chain rule product rule and quotoent rule tbh
[12/7/19, 6:35:24 AM] Yi Kai: Yah
[12/7/19, 6:35:37 AM] Yi Kai: V du times u dv divide v^2 right
[12/7/19, 6:35:59 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: differentiate tbe top one first

[14/7/19, 8:38:09 PM] Yi Kai: On the actual day when we were eating, at one point he was like "Not my fault right she keep DMing me"
[14/7/19, 8:38:13 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: are all the examples needed available in the textbook
[14/7/19, 8:38:18 PM] Yi Kai: Yah

[14/7/19, 8:42:42 PM] Yi Kai: Since chap 9 she gave notes
[14/7/19, 8:42:47 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: then part b they give 2 things then u have to describe and compare
[14/7/19, 8:43:14 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: all those r examples meh
[14/7/19, 8:43:28 PM] Yi Kai: The stats
[14/7/19, 8:43:34 PM] Yi Kai: That's the best I could find
[14/7/19, 8:43:44 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: no what they usually ask how
[14/7/19, 8:43:43 PM] Yi Kai: If you can have better stuff send pls
[14/7/19, 8:43:50 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: like specifically what examples
[14/7/19, 8:43:56 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i havent mug yet
[14/7/19, 8:44:04 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: maybe ill try the textbook later
[14/7/19, 8:44:09 PM] Yi Kai: Ok true
[14/7/19, 8:44:33 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i tell u if i can find stuff in the textbook
[14/7/19, 11:53:50 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: yeah just use the examples from textbook
[15/7/19, 6:16:48 AM] Yi Kai: There’s notes for both chapters by the way
[15/7/19, 6:48:04 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: did cohen give
[15/7/19, 6:48:36 AM] Yi Kai: Yah
[15/7/19, 6:48:46 AM] Yi Kai: I didn’t know until Zhiheng told me
[15/7/19, 6:48:50 AM] Yi Kai: It’s department notes
[15/7/19, 6:49:51 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: same tbh
[15/7/19, 6:50:04 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: the file name is JL and Shanthi tho

[18/7/19, 2:44:10 PM] Yi Kai: Sorry lah
[18/7/19, 2:44:15 PM] Yi Kai: I was walking and typing
[18/7/19, 2:44:47 PM] Yi Kai: Blind typing basically

On com it’s quite easy. On phone it heavily relies on autocorrect
[18/7/19, 2:44:59 PM] Yi Kai: Which sadly doesn’t correct some of the ‘b’ to space
[18/7/19, 2:44:59 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: lol
[18/7/19, 2:45:08 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i tried that before
[18/7/19, 2:45:13 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: sia were not going out ah
[18/7/19, 2:45:32 PM] Yi Kai: Hopefully
[18/7/19, 2:45:42 PM] Yi Kai: Actually go out also good I’m bored Liao
[18/7/19, 2:55:57 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ya same
[18/7/19, 8:10:30 PM] Yi Kai: Wah lao SIA so stupid
[18/7/19, 8:10:58 PM] Yi Kai: Idw watch movie siah, like legit

It's most likely they go watch spiderman, then watch again quite waste money since ten dollars
[18/7/19, 8:20:35 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: wtfak
[18/7/19, 8:20:43 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: can we go slack at some restaurant or smth
[18/7/19, 8:20:45 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: idl watching movies
[18/7/19, 8:48:12 PM] Yi Kai: Ok
[18/7/19, 8:48:14 PM] Yi Kai: I go with you
[18/7/19, 8:48:23 PM] Yi Kai: Library should have
[18/7/19, 8:48:44 PM] Yi Kai: Tbh if we sneak off no one will care/know

Just that I asked malcolm if can do that so he'll pay more attention to ensure I stay
[18/7/19, 8:49:06 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: he said can walk around mall if dw to watch movie in his message whay
[18/7/19, 8:49:25 PM] Yi Kai: Yah
[18/7/19, 8:49:31 PM] Yi Kai: When I say sneak off I mean just go home
[18/7/19, 8:49:48 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oh
[18/7/19, 8:49:48 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: bruh
[18/7/19, 8:50:04 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i just want liho
[18/7/19, 8:50:09 PM] Yi Kai: ...
[18/7/19, 8:50:14 PM] Yi Kai: My house nearby have liao tbh
[18/7/19, 8:50:21 PM] Yi Kai: Chateraise also have
[18/7/19, 8:50:32 PM] Yi Kai: But I never buy liho

Rarely eat chateraise
[18/7/19, 8:50:59 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: im probably not going home though
[18/7/19, 8:51:03 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: idk what to do also
[18/7/19, 9:09:15 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: Can you like make it less abrupt *nex*t time
[18/7/19, 9:09:30 PM] Yi Kai: ...
[18/7/19, 9:10:34 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: lol
[20/7/19, 9:53:00 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: do u mind lending ur big buttons to elddfs in jc cus they need 2 sets of uniforms for their performance
[20/7/19, 9:53:07 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: they will return by 31 july
[20/7/19, 10:19:56 AM] Yi Kai: Wait lend to who, and for what performance
[20/7/19, 10:24:55 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: Dear Mr Tan and Ms Tan,


I'm Thames Teo, a representative of the JC English Literature Drama Debate Society and we're putting up a performance in school next Thursday and Friday.


We'll be performing a British comedy titled "Rumours" by Neil Simon, and two of the characters are policemen. Thus, we were wondering if we could borrow two sets of plain NPCC uniforms from Monday, 22nd July to the following Monday, 29th. 


As an estimate, we're looking for a size L uniform, size 36 pants, and a size M uniform, size 30 pants. When would be a good time for us to come down for a fitting?


Thank you so much for your assistance.


Yours sincerely,

Thames Teo

[20/7/19, 2:36:08 PM] Yi Kai: Should have lah
[20/7/19, 6:34:00 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: do w ehave anyth after proj finals
[20/7/19, 6:51:07 PM] Yi Kai: CSC lorh
[20/7/19, 6:51:31 PM] Yi Kai: Not that day lah
[20/7/19, 7:03:20 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: huh what csc
[20/7/19, 7:04:02 PM] Yi Kai: CT
[20/7/19, 7:49:04 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: omg
[20/7/19, 7:49:07 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: theres another one
[20/7/19, 7:49:08 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: kslfkdlsl
[21/7/19, 11:04:55 AM] Yi Kai: Tbh I a bit 不爽 need go handover on projects day
[21/7/19, 11:05:09 AM] Yi Kai: Cause Infocomm always dismissed at like 12
[21/7/19, 11:05:23 AM] Yi Kai: Finish by 11, free time until 12
[21/7/19, 11:51:45 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: lol so good
[21/7/19, 11:51:49 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ours a lot of projects
[21/7/19, 11:52:58 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i eanna play werewolf
[21/7/19, 11:55:03 AM] Yi Kai: Oh yah
[21/7/19, 1:47:08 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: can u bring ur big buttons tmr
[21/7/19, 1:47:16 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i take from u instead cus easier
[21/7/19, 2:28:07 PM] Yi Kai: Fine
[21/7/19, 2:28:11 PM] Yi Kai: Must by tomorrow ah?
[21/7/19, 2:29:28 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ya they taking tmr
[21/7/19, 2:50:39 PM] Yi Kai: Sien
[21/7/19, 2:51:06 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: why
‎[21/7/19, 2:51:17 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ‎image omitted
[21/7/19, 2:52:14 PM] Yi Kai: Compare ADE and DEC
[21/7/19, 2:52:30 PM] Yi Kai: And drawing line AC cuts parallelogram into 2 equal areas
[21/7/19, 2:53:09 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: but udk length ae
[21/7/19, 3:08:08 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: nvm
[21/7/19, 3:25:14 PM] Yi Kai: Cause ADE and CEF are similar
[21/7/19, 3:25:28 PM] Yi Kai: So AE:CE is 3:1
[21/7/19, 3:25:44 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: 1:24 right
[21/7/19, 3:25:57 PM] Yi Kai: Yah
[21/7/19, 3:26:03 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: yay
[21/7/19, 3:26:04 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: thanks
[21/7/19, 11:29:40 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: rmb to bring ah
[22/7/19, 6:06:02 AM] Yi Kai: Crap
[22/7/19, 6:06:36 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: wat
[22/7/19, 6:18:05 AM] Yi Kai: Nvm I brought
[22/7/19, 6:18:21 AM] Yi Kai: Thanks for reminding
[22/7/19, 6:33:49 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: thxx
[22/7/19, 9:07:46 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: so minitiature circuit breaker is placed on the live wire with the switch and the fuse?
[22/7/19, 9:08:26 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: does the fuse and the mcb serve different purpose?
[22/7/19, 9:08:40 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: and for the earth leakage circuit breaker is it placed on the earth wire
[22/7/19, 10:26:46 PM] Yi Kai: Yes.

All safety measures except earth wire is put on live wire
[22/7/19, 10:26:57 PM] Yi Kai: I don't understand the point of mcb and elcb
[22/7/19, 10:27:25 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: mcb and elcb is resettable i guess
[22/7/19, 10:28:05 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: idk why u need an elcb though is it just to show the user that theres esrth leakage
[22/7/19, 10:28:18 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: cus by right even if current passes through earth wire its harmless right
[22/7/19, 10:28:50 PM] Yi Kai: Elcb more for the 电箱
[22/7/19, 10:28:59 PM] Yi Kai: You know the thing which gets triggered when got lightning one
[22/7/19, 10:29:10 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: its the elcb?
[22/7/19, 10:29:38 PM] Yi Kai: If elcb don't trigger then earth wire trigger, then will trigger the fuse

To replace fuse more mafan 'cause need replace the whole plug or open up replace fuse
[22/7/19, 10:29:41 PM] Yi Kai: Google images
[22/7/19, 10:30:08 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i thought earth wire must trigger first
[22/7/19, 10:30:09 PM] Yi Kai: serves as mcb as well
[22/7/19, 10:30:15 PM] Yi Kai: Yes
[22/7/19, 10:30:43 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: fuse blowing isnt due to current leakage right
[22/7/19, 10:30:48 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: its excess current
[22/7/19, 10:30:52 PM] Yi Kai: Yah
[22/7/19, 10:30:57 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: why am i still at practical electricity
[22/7/19, 10:31:02 PM] Yi Kai: So if it connects to neutral or earth wire both will trigger
[22/7/19, 10:31:13 PM] Yi Kai: Tbh only this one isn't no shit if you ask me
[22/7/19, 10:31:23 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: got fuse connect to earth one meh
[22/7/19, 10:31:30 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: yeah but i forgot everyth as usuap
[22/7/19, 10:31:32 PM] Yi Kai: Fuse is on live wire
[22/7/19, 10:31:37 PM] Yi Kai: Earth connect to casing
[22/7/19, 10:31:52 PM] Yi Kai: If somehow the live wire touch the metal casing, then it'll kinda connect to earth wire
[22/7/19, 10:32:01 PM] Yi Kai: So that the metal casing doesn't become live
[22/7/19, 10:32:02 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: wts
[22/7/19, 10:32:11 PM] Yi Kai: Then overall become flow to earth lorh
[22/7/19, 10:32:17 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: how does yhat work
[22/7/19, 10:32:48 PM] Yi Kai: 'Cause metal casing connected to earth wire
[22/7/19, 10:32:56 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oh
[22/7/19, 10:32:59 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: chey
[22/7/19, 10:33:02 PM] Yi Kai: Bruh after a day of doing this can you at least understand this topic...
[22/7/19, 10:33:11 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i havent done anything tbh
[23/7/19, 6:29:21 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: is it right to say slip rings are used for ac and split rings for dc
[23/7/19, 6:29:43 AM] Yi Kai: Why everyone want to Mug that thing...
[23/7/19, 6:30:08 AM] Yi Kai: It’s kinda you remember the laws, they show you that sort of stuff and you figure out what’s going on
[23/7/19, 6:30:14 AM] Yi Kai: Anyway yes it’s correct
[23/7/19, 6:30:37 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: which alws
[23/7/19, 6:30:40 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: laws
[23/7/19, 6:30:43 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: faraday lens?
[23/7/19, 6:30:50 AM] Yi Kai: Lenz
[23/7/19, 6:30:54 AM] Yi Kai: Left hand right hand
[23/7/19, 6:31:02 AM] Yi Kai: Actually idek what the law states
[23/7/19, 6:47:02 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: its the opposing motion thing
[23/7/19, 6:47:08 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: the solenoids magnet poles
[23/7/19, 6:47:15 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: faraday is what again
[23/7/19, 6:47:16 AM] Yi Kai: Huh?
[23/7/19, 6:47:21 AM] Yi Kai: ^
[23/7/19, 6:47:31 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: when u move a magnet away or towards the solenoid
[23/7/19, 6:47:33 AM] Yi Kai: You mean drop magnet through coil
[23/7/19, 6:47:42 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: the solenoids poles will change to oppose the motion
[23/7/19, 6:47:46 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ya
[23/7/19, 6:48:00 AM] Yi Kai: Oh you meant the law?
[23/7/19, 6:48:14 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: what did u mean
[23/7/19, 6:48:43 AM] Yi Kai: There was a demo

Where she brought a Long tube and dropped a magnet through it
[23/7/19, 6:48:53 AM] Yi Kai: Then the magnet was like super slow
[23/7/19, 6:49:21 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oh
[23/7/19, 6:49:24 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ya same thing
[23/7/19, 6:59:09 AM] Yi Kai: Oh
[23/7/19, 6:59:23 AM] Yi Kai: Lenz law is about polarity of emf
[23/7/19, 6:59:34 AM] Yi Kai: Faradays law is about magnitude
[23/7/19, 6:59:47 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: proportional to rate of change of magnetic flux
[23/7/19, 6:59:55 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: wait how
[23/7/19, 6:59:58 AM] Yi Kai: Yah
[23/7/19, 7:00:04 AM] Yi Kai: What the you dk meh
[23/7/19, 7:00:16 AM] Yi Kai: No wonder you memorising slip rings give AC
[23/7/19, 7:00:19 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i always thought its just the opposing magnet thing
[23/7/19, 7:00:23 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: lmao
[23/7/19, 7:00:36 AM] Yi Kai: Yah
[23/7/19, 7:00:53 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ohoh
[23/7/19, 7:01:06 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: the current direction needs to change to change the poles of the solenoid
[23/7/19, 7:01:18 AM] Yi Kai: Emf induced such that the magnetic field generated by the emf opposes the initial changing magnetic field
[23/7/19, 7:01:34 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: yay
[23/7/19, 7:01:41 AM] Yi Kai: What kinda phrasing is that
[23/7/19, 7:01:54 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: physics c6 phrasing
[23/7/19, 7:02:01 AM] Yi Kai: It’s like more retarded than the research papers I’ve been trying to understand
[23/7/19, 7:02:21 AM] Yi Kai: I read cause I was figuring out how to train bot
[23/7/19, 7:02:37 AM] Yi Kai: Anyway I was going to bring com but I got lazy cause of the weight
[23/7/19, 7:03:30 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: just borrow or smth lor
[23/7/19, 7:03:37 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: how dare u
[23/7/19, 7:03:55 AM] Yi Kai: Yah that’s what I thought
[23/7/19, 7:04:11 AM] Yi Kai: At first I was thinking I can run the training during lesson v good
[23/7/19, 7:04:15 AM] Yi Kai: Then I got lazy
[23/7/19, 7:04:20 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: lol
[23/7/19, 7:04:26 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: what are we even doing anyways
[23/7/19, 5:12:46 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: https://www.instagram.com/p/B0N7fnogJnL/?igshid=1vsu3vdabei79
[23/7/19, 5:12:46 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: free bubble tea for csm if u clock 10000 steps during this week
[23/7/19, 5:13:53 PM] Yi Kai: How to proof?
[23/7/19, 5:14:03 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: just take screenshot can alr
[23/7/19, 5:14:06 PM] Yi Kai: I’ll start wearing tracker I Guess. I get it everyday
[23/7/19, 5:14:06 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i alr tried
[23/7/19, 5:14:11 PM] Yi Kai: Wow
[23/7/19, 5:14:19 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: 10000 steps u just need for 1 day
[23/7/19, 5:14:27 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: kinda easy to scam but yea
[23/7/19, 5:14:33 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: limited to first 350
[23/7/19, 5:14:59 PM] Yi Kai: But then I find 1 whole cup a bit too much
[23/7/19, 5:20:12 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: what the
[23/7/19, 5:20:14 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: share lor
[23/7/19, 5:20:32 PM] Yi Kai: Aiyah dao lah
[25/7/19, 6:11:03 PM] Yi Kai: Now I feel retarded wearing this yellow NOI shirt
[25/7/19, 6:17:31 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: lol why did u change
[25/7/19, 6:18:27 PM] Yi Kai: Silver friends one looks ugly
[25/7/19, 6:19:05 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: true
[25/7/19, 6:19:23 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: u just reached sch ah
[25/7/19, 6:20:29 PM] Yi Kai: On train
[25/7/19, 6:20:49 PM] Yi Kai: Anyway the thing is my shirt usually L so a bit loose for comfort
[25/7/19, 6:21:13 PM] Yi Kai: Then under particulars we saw a gender column so all put M, then everyone including the damn small guy got M
[25/7/19, 6:21:39 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: LOL
[25/7/19, 6:21:47 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: my gender is S
[25/7/19, 6:23:51 PM] Yi Kai: Or at least we thought it’s gender
[25/7/19, 6:24:06 PM] Yi Kai: Cause everyone in front input in excel as M. No heading one so yah
[25/7/19, 6:24:25 PM] Yi Kai: Like we did combined selection test with RI then yah
[25/7/19, 6:27:23 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: lol
[25/7/19, 6:27:35 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: s stands for semi female
[25/7/19, 6:27:44 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: do u want cooking
[25/7/19, 6:27:51 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i find it pointles
[25/7/19, 6:28:15 PM] Yi Kai: Same
[25/7/19, 6:28:25 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: the food sucks anyways
[26/7/19, 8:57:38 AM] Yi Kai: Hmm left home a moment ago
[26/7/19, 9:31:43 PM] Yi Kai: https://guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/most-pen-spinning-fingerpasses-in-one-minute
[26/7/19, 10:08:56 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: doable
[26/7/19, 10:09:29 PM] Yi Kai: My record was 67 rmb
[26/7/19, 10:10:24 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ya
[26/7/19, 10:10:36 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i dun believe the record is so little tho
[26/7/19, 10:11:55 PM] Yi Kai: Q hard tbh
[26/7/19, 10:23:31 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ure close enough alr
[26/7/19, 10:25:21 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ouchh
[26/7/19, 10:25:27 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: u didnt have to do yiqin like that
[26/7/19, 10:25:27 PM] Yi Kai: Sry I had to
[26/7/19, 10:25:37 PM] Yi Kai: But legit what
[26/7/19, 10:25:40 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i mean i abit too
[26/7/19, 10:25:51 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: but idk if its cus of the japanese song
[26/7/19, 10:25:56 PM] Yi Kai: Ok fine
[26/7/19, 10:26:21 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: the 2nd one was betyer than the first one tho
[26/7/19, 10:26:47 PM] Yi Kai: True
[26/7/19, 10:26:54 PM] Yi Kai: #7_min_song
[26/7/19, 10:27:06 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: lets sing almost is never enough
[26/7/19, 10:27:20 PM] Yi Kai: That's difficult tbh
[26/7/19, 10:27:24 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: loll
[26/7/19, 10:27:31 PM] Yi Kai: But I'm sure gavriel can one lah
[26/7/19, 10:27:32 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: get gavriel to do the damn high aprts
[26/7/19, 10:28:12 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: or we can do prng you again
[26/7/19, 10:28:15 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: so cool?!
[26/7/19, 10:28:24 PM] Yi Kai: find u again ah?
[26/7/19, 10:28:26 PM] Yi Kai: That's fine
[26/7/19, 10:28:36 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: wdym again
[26/7/19, 10:28:37 PM] Yi Kai: But if you want do that might as well do like senorita
[26/7/19, 10:28:50 PM] Yi Kai: Or like ik what you did last summer
[26/7/19, 10:28:57 PM] Yi Kai: The song is "find u again"
[26/7/19, 10:29:02 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: whos gonna sing  the camila cabello psrt
[26/7/19, 10:29:14 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i meant 朋友
[26/7/19, 10:29:17 PM] Yi Kai: That's the only prob cause she's damn high
[26/7/19, 10:29:20 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ahahaha
[26/7/19, 10:29:22 PM] Yi Kai: Oh cheah
[26/7/19, 10:29:28 PM] Yi Kai: I was like what you typo
[26/7/19, 10:29:40 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: idk what find u again is
[26/7/19, 10:29:53 PM] Yi Kai: It's a decent song
[26/7/19, 10:29:57 PM] Yi Kai: With an indecent video
[26/7/19, 10:30:09 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: most videos are indecent
[26/7/19, 10:30:12 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: nowadays
[26/7/19, 10:30:30 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: why they al like japanese stuff so much
[26/7/19, 10:30:32 PM] Yi Kai: I doubt that
[26/7/19, 10:30:43 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: the music videos at least
[26/7/19, 10:30:41 PM] Yi Kai: How ik, damn retarded one lorh
[26/7/19, 10:30:53 PM] Yi Kai: That's what I doubt
[26/7/19, 10:30:58 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ya its like japanese stuff everywhere
[26/7/19, 10:31:06 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: class shirt
[26/7/19, 10:31:07 PM] Yi Kai: True
[26/7/19, 10:31:31 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: id like to say we gave it a try
[26/7/19, 10:32:01 PM] Yi Kai: Crap I actually can't continue
[26/7/19, 10:32:13 PM] Yi Kai: I'd like to something one
[26/7/19, 10:32:17 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: id like to blame it all on life
[26/7/19, 10:32:24 PM] Yi Kai: maybe we just weren't right
[26/7/19, 10:32:26 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: maybe we just werent right
[26/7/19, 10:32:30 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: but thats a lie
[26/7/19, 10:32:33 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: thats a lie
[26/7/19, 10:32:38 PM] Yi Kai: And we can deny it as much as we want
[26/7/19, 10:32:43 PM] Yi Kai: But in time our feelings will show
[26/7/19, 10:32:52 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: sooner or later
[26/7/19, 10:33:01 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: we'll wonder why we gave up
[26/7/19, 10:33:05 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: the truth is no one knows
[26/7/19, 10:34:06 PM] Yi Kai: Supposed to be everyone knows lol
[26/7/19, 10:34:13 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: legit
[26/7/19, 10:34:13 PM] Yi Kai: Almost, almost is never enough
[26/7/19, 10:34:17 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: LOL
[26/7/19, 10:34:24 PM] Yi Kai: So close to being in love
[26/7/19, 10:34:47 PM] Yi Kai: if I would have known that you wanted me, the way I wanted you
[26/7/19, 10:34:57 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: then maybe we wouldnt be two worlds apart
[26/7/19, 10:35:11 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: but right here in each others arms

[26/7/19, 10:40:29 PM] Yi Kai: For jap, their tongue goes in the middle of these 2 places

[26/7/19, 10:40:52 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: for both l and r?
[26/7/19, 10:41:31 PM] Yi Kai: It's the same
‎[26/7/19, 10:42:04 PM] Yi Kai: ‎image omitted
[26/7/19, 10:42:17 PM] Yi Kai: But if you read other language words with l, in jap it's just r

[26/7/19, 10:43:31 PM] Yi Kai: Then it'll be na i
[26/7/19, 10:43:40 PM] Yi Kai: Like the leftmost n is only for ending sounds
[26/7/19, 10:43:55 PM] Yi Kai: But if you read it fast it doesn't matter

[1/8/19, 5:06:01 PM] Yi Kai: Let x be the distance from home
[1/8/19, 5:06:12 PM] Yi Kai: For each one can calculate a linear equation of time taken
[1/8/19, 5:06:20 PM] Yi Kai: Then find where they meet
[1/8/19, 5:06:40 PM] Yi Kai: The lines form something we call convex hull speed up for NOI
[1/8/19, 5:06:45 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ohhhh
[1/8/19, 5:06:46 PM] Yi Kai: V advanced stuff

[1/8/19, 5:08:26 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i rng C
[1/8/19, 5:08:30 PM] Yi Kai: ...
[1/8/19, 5:08:32 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i think c is 540
[1/8/19, 5:08:48 PM] Yi Kai: You could brute force that even if you care about intermediate wheels
[1/8/19, 5:08:54 PM] Yi Kai: Wow...
[1/8/19, 5:08:58 PM] Yi Kai: Doubt that
[1/8/19, 5:09:00 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: idk how to

[1/8/19, 5:12:27 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: wtcrao
[1/8/19, 5:12:41 PM] Yi Kai: Each grid just take minimum of what you see on right and what you see on front
[1/8/19, 5:12:47 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i calculated 24 based on front then i just anyhow minus based on right
[1/8/19, 5:13:03 PM] Yi Kai: Computational thinking
[1/8/19, 5:13:19 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: lol dun understand
[1/8/19, 5:13:40 PM] Yi Kai: For each square, the height can not exceed what you see from the front right?
[1/8/19, 5:13:45 PM] Yi Kai: Like the row/column
[1/8/19, 5:13:52 PM] Yi Kai: Same thing for right
[1/8/19, 5:18:15 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oh

[2/8/19, 6:37:37 AM] Yi Kai: Wow
[2/8/19, 6:37:48 AM] Yi Kai: I briefly read through the whole thing during holidays
[2/8/19, 6:37:54 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oh
[2/8/19, 6:37:55 AM] Yi Kai: But I don’t remember that much
[2/8/19, 6:38:16 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i barely mugged for el ct though
[2/8/19, 6:39:47 AM] Yi Kai: I just looked through my el compre mistakes

May I know if Yi Kai, Guan Lin, Shao Jun and I can be excused from CCA for the forum? We're not involved in SBNDP
[02/08, 12:24 am] Boston: Sorry for informing you last minute, Mr Tan
[02/08, 6:49 am] Mr Tan Hui Kuan: Ok.whats the training about for sec 4?
[02/08, 6:57 am] Boston: It is selfstudy and RT
[2/8/19, 6:59:06 AM] Yi Kai: Lol
[2/8/19, 6:59:32 AM] Yi Kai: The way he replies us is like we’re sec 1s when sec 4 squad is like so slack

[2/8/19, 7:00:13 AM] Yi Kai: Didn’t even bring it to school
[2/8/19, 7:00:18 AM] Yi Kai: Did she said need to bring?
[2/8/19, 7:00:21 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: adequate preparation is the pathway to success
[2/8/19, 7:00:23 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: note

[2/8/19, 7:00:35 AM] Yi Kai: Wow
[2/8/19, 7:00:51 AM] Yi Kai: You call 45 minutes adequate?
[2/8/19, 7:00:58 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: hey!
[2/8/19, 7:01:17 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: any preparation is more adequate than no preparation
[2/8/19, 7:01:27 AM] Yi Kai: It may be more than nothing, but having *almost* adequate predation *is never enough*
[2/8/19, 7:01:42 AM] Yi Kai: Preparation*
[2/8/19, 7:01:45 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: omg predation

[3/8/19, 2:44:35 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: in east direction
[3/8/19, 2:46:34 PM] Yi Kai: Can be 30 deg to south or north? Usually I’ll specify southeast, 30 deg from east or sth
[3/8/19, 2:48:28 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: what if theres no direction
[3/8/19, 2:48:40 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: like they give u the velocity in 2 directions
[3/8/19, 2:48:55 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: do u say like 30° from 3.0ms-1 velocity direction
[3/8/19, 5:04:39 PM] Yi Kai: Then I don’t know

[4/8/19, 1:50:48 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: it was v stupid now that i think of it
[4/8/19, 2:28:32 PM] Yi Kai: P5 competition some more you know
[4/8/19, 2:28:54 PM] Yi Kai: I just googled your full name with quotation marks and that’s what I got
[4/8/19, 2:29:13 PM] Yi Kai: The kind of full name with English + Chinese name v easy to fine one
[4/8/19, 2:31:01 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i shall name u bernard tan yi kai and u shall employ the use of such name in your further future

[4/8/19, 2:32:16 PM] Yi Kai: Which side atmospheric air?
[4/8/19, 2:32:28 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: b is gas pressure
[4/8/19, 2:32:33 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: they inject the gas
[4/8/19, 2:32:58 PM] Yi Kai: What’s patm?
[4/8/19, 2:33:05 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: atmospheric pressure
[4/8/19, 2:33:14 PM] Yi Kai: Left side is atmospheric air lah
[4/8/19, 2:33:31 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i thought one side msut be closed one
[4/8/19, 2:33:33 PM] Yi Kai: So the pressure on C is Pac + atm
[4/8/19, 2:33:39 PM] Yi Kai: Right side is closed
[4/8/19, 2:33:53 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: right side is the gas supply
[4/8/19, 2:34:12 PM] Yi Kai: So it’s not connected to outside air lorh
[4/8/19, 2:34:29 PM] Yi Kai: So right side is just the pressure of the gas supply pushing on B
[4/8/19, 2:34:43 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oh
[4/8/19, 2:34:56 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: where r u at for physics otot

[4/8/19, 2:35:57 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: wat
[4/8/19, 2:35:59 PM] Yi Kai: I told him to ask you or jiaquan
[4/8/19, 2:36:07 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: excus me
[4/8/19, 2:36:09 PM] Yi Kai: He ask me if mine is clean
[4/8/19, 2:36:11 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: that is an insult

[4/8/19, 3:28:44 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: how to determine centre og gravity for an object
[4/8/19, 3:30:11 PM] Yi Kai: I don't know
[4/8/19, 3:30:28 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: is it just centre
[4/8/19, 3:30:30 PM] Yi Kai: That's why I asked for google site
[4/8/19, 3:30:34 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: the ws says need show working
[4/8/19, 3:30:44 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ut has nth lol
[4/8/19, 3:30:49 PM] Yi Kai: If it is the centre, then if you take it as a pivot it'll balance
[4/8/19, 3:31:04 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: but the shapes r weird
[4/8/19, 3:31:04 PM] Yi Kai: That's the only thing I understand
[4/8/19, 3:31:42 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: c) is just centre of circle
[4/8/19, 3:31:49 PM] Yi Kai: Wait actually, if you take the side as a pivot, then calculate the total moment and divide it by the the total mass, you could get the centre of gravity
[4/8/19, 3:31:55 PM] Yi Kai: Lemme go get my ws
[4/8/19, 3:32:20 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: the sides r not the same shape though
[4/8/19, 3:33:02 PM] Yi Kai: For a 2d object
[4/8/19, 3:33:19 PM] Yi Kai: During aviation science, the guy say you just take each of the object in the system

[4/8/19, 3:41:09 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: and why do u need to do that thing 3 times when it alr intersects at the 2nd time
[4/8/19, 3:41:23 PM] Yi Kai: 3rd time for confirmation
[4/8/19, 3:41:38 PM] Yi Kai: But then how to do it if we don't have the object siah
[4/8/19, 3:41:48 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: wait wth
[4/8/19, 3:41:57 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: how u know where to draw the line
[4/8/19, 3:42:14 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: exactly

[4/8/19, 5:05:11 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oh wair its kinda the same thing
[4/8/19, 5:06:24 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: does it matter if the pivot and the 2 moments arent on the same line
[4/8/19, 5:07:38 PM] Yi Kai: Doesn't
[4/8/19, 5:07:55 PM] Yi Kai: The moment just only cares about rotational direction
[4/8/19, 5:07:56 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oh then ok what

[9/8/19, 6:23:36 PM] Yi Kai: Went to research, it's candidate master, the worst kind of master among all the FIDE titles
[9/8/19, 6:23:50 PM] Yi Kai: But then to get that title, your elo must be at least 2200 officially
[9/8/19, 6:23:57 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: how he drop so much

[18/8/19, 1:47:30 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: what r ur 2 equations
[18/8/19, 1:47:31 PM] Yi Kai: Part a is (2-2lambda) a + lambda b
‎[18/8/19, 1:47:37 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ‎image omitted
[18/8/19, 1:47:51 PM] Yi Kai: What's your part a?
‎[18/8/19, 1:48:03 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ‎image omitted
[18/8/19, 1:48:09 PM] Yi Kai: Basically the coefficients of a are the same, coefficients of b are the same
[18/8/19, 1:48:15 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ya ik
[18/8/19, 1:48:27 PM] Yi Kai: For part a, write in terms of AB
[18/8/19, 1:48:47 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: why
[18/8/19, 1:48:51 PM] Yi Kai: Just do it
[18/8/19, 1:48:54 PM] Yi Kai: It'll cancel out
[18/8/19, 1:49:06 PM] Yi Kai: Using the property stated above in the same page
[18/8/19, 1:49:15 PM] Yi Kai: AB is like m+n
[18/8/19, 1:49:26 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: AD is 入
[18/8/19, 1:49:35 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: AB is 1
[18/8/19, 1:49:36 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: is it
[18/8/19, 1:49:58 PM] Yi Kai: Is lambda * AB
[18/8/19, 1:50:05 PM] Yi Kai: AB is just AB
[18/8/19, 1:50:12 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: as in their ratios
[18/8/19, 1:50:21 PM] Yi Kai: and BD is (1- lambda) of AB
[18/8/19, 1:50:38 PM] Yi Kai: Yah lah, but not v nice to work with
[18/8/19, 1:50:44 PM] Yi Kai: Your part a is wrong, that's why
[18/8/19, 1:50:55 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oh
[18/8/19, 1:50:54 PM] Yi Kai: ^
[18/8/19, 1:51:08 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: no divisor ah
[18/8/19, 1:51:57 PM] Yi Kai: Don't have
[18/8/19, 1:52:03 PM] Yi Kai: AB is my divisor
[18/8/19, 1:52:05 PM] Yi Kai: But it cancels out
[18/8/19, 1:54:58 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oh got it
[18/8/19, 1:55:03 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: why is my method wrong tho
[18/8/19, 1:57:14 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: nvm my ratio is wrong to begin with
[18/8/19, 1:57:46 PM] Yi Kai: V lazy do practice questions tbh

[18/8/19, 8:39:36 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: like an album ah
[18/8/19, 8:39:42 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: lol
[18/8/19, 8:39:44 PM] Yi Kai: True
[18/8/19, 8:39:50 PM] Yi Kai: I gave zhouxuan a speaker
[18/8/19, 8:39:51 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: heres an ariana grande poster
[18/8/19, 8:39:59 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: did he ask for it
[18/8/19, 8:40:02 PM] Yi Kai: It's just weird
[18/8/19, 8:40:12 PM] Yi Kai: He said anything, then he suggested sth tech-related
[18/8/19, 8:40:20 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: im tempted to say soft toy cus i cant think of anyth useful i need
[18/8/19, 8:40:28 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oh
[18/8/19, 8:40:36 PM] Yi Kai: Actually it's better for me to say I can do rubik cubes, and that I fidget a lot
[18/8/19, 8:40:45 PM] Yi Kai: Don't soft toy
[18/8/19, 8:40:55 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: later he gives u a fidget spinner
[18/8/19, 8:41:00 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: why
[18/8/19, 8:41:10 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: zongjun said soft toy when i asked him last year
[18/8/19, 8:41:30 PM] Yi Kai: I'm fine with that
[18/8/19, 8:41:42 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: wth
[18/8/19, 8:41:42 PM] Yi Kai: I was tempted to buy it so many times in china
[18/8/19, 8:41:50 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: those fidget cubes r cooler
[18/8/19, 8:41:59 PM] Yi Kai: And then got this thing called Jacob's ladder that they sell on the streets
[18/8/19, 8:42:03 PM] Yi Kai: I have it
[18/8/19, 8:42:07 PM] Yi Kai: I just dislike it
[18/8/19, 8:42:15 PM] Yi Kai: And I haven't used it for so long, the metal ball got rusty
[18/8/19, 8:42:18 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: its more fun than a fifget spinner
[18/8/19, 8:42:32 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: but nothing beats a pen
[18/8/19, 8:42:44 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ^
[18/8/19, 8:43:45 PM] Yi Kai: That spin kind of pen is just ex...
[18/8/19, 8:43:57 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: im talking about pilot g2
[18/8/19, 8:44:47 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: are graphing calculators v expensice
[18/8/19, 8:44:49 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: they look expensice
[18/8/19, 8:44:54 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: expensive
[18/8/19, 8:45:19 PM] Yi Kai: Normal calc is $20-25 so...
[18/8/19, 8:45:33 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: kiasuparent says its $160
[18/8/19, 8:45:34 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oops
[18/8/19, 8:45:35 PM] Yi Kai: Randy was suggesting about buying me H2 chem textbook...
[18/8/19, 8:45:40 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: LOL
[18/8/19, 8:45:47 PM] Yi Kai: When I rejected he changed to H2 physics
[18/8/19, 8:45:52 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: r u talking to him now
[18/8/19, 8:45:55 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: wow
[18/8/19, 8:45:57 PM] Yi Kai: He got offline
[18/8/19, 8:46:10 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: do we even use the textbook in jc
[18/8/19, 8:46:12 PM] Yi Kai: I have quite a lot at home tbh
[18/8/19, 8:46:15 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i thought its just notes
[18/8/19, 8:46:23 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: mine r all v small
[18/8/19, 8:46:25 PM] Yi Kai: I'm not someone who cares about my textbook
[18/8/19, 8:46:39 PM] Yi Kai: When I went taiwan exchange, I won a baymax soft toy
[18/8/19, 8:46:47 PM] Yi Kai: From shooting
[18/8/19, 8:46:51 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: wow
[18/8/19, 8:46:54 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: marksman!
[18/8/19, 8:46:55 PM] Yi Kai: It literally occupied my whole day pack
[18/8/19, 8:47:06 PM] Yi Kai: It's freakin <5m away
[18/8/19, 8:47:29 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oops
[18/8/19, 8:47:33 PM] Yi Kai: Me bringing it back was v meme, but yah it's about the size of 1.5 human heads
[18/8/19, 8:47:43 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: thats q small what
[18/8/19, 8:47:53 PM] Yi Kai: Width 20cm
[18/8/19, 8:48:02 PM] Yi Kai: Height about 30cm
[18/8/19, 8:48:22 PM] Yi Kai: If you judge that as small, I start to question as you say your soft toys are v small
‎[18/8/19, 8:49:02 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ‎image omitted
[18/8/19, 8:49:25 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ok la its ay least bigger than this
[18/8/19, 8:50:50 PM] Yi Kai: Yah
[18/8/19, 8:51:00 PM] Yi Kai: That looks like its from happy feet
[18/8/19, 8:51:12 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i bought it from china immersion in p5
[18/8/19, 8:51:20 PM] Yi Kai: Oh
[18/8/19, 8:53:02 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: so r u getting that h2 textbook
[18/8/19, 8:53:09 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: its a very good idea !
[18/8/19, 9:23:27 PM] Yi Kai: No
[19/8/19, 9:15:25 PM] Yi Kai: OMG I just had 2 singaporean players on chess
[19/8/19, 9:15:32 PM] Yi Kai: Within the last 15 minutes
[19/8/19, 9:15:35 PM] Yi Kai: Like it’s so rare
[19/8/19, 9:15:40 PM] Yi Kai: Maybe they’re all v good
[19/8/19, 10:23:59 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: bruh 30 mins nap become 3 hrs
[19/8/19, 11:14:23 PM] Yi Kai: Hmm
[19/8/19, 11:14:36 PM] Yi Kai: 30 minute naps never work unless I sleep on the floor without turning off the lights
[20/8/19, 12:10:50 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: lol wth
[20/8/19, 12:11:03 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: sleeping on the floor
[24/8/19, 12:51:16 PM] Yi Kai: By the way, the trick Guan Lin does is called the sonic
[24/8/19, 12:51:41 PM] Yi Kai: I succeeded once, it's damn hard. Basically need move middle finger damn fast one
[24/8/19, 1:00:14 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: but the way he does it makes it look v weird
[24/8/19, 1:00:27 PM] Yi Kai: Weird in what way
[24/8/19, 1:00:40 PM] Yi Kai: It's basically like twirl one round, but after the twirl it changes finger
‎[24/8/19, 1:00:45 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ‎image omitted
[24/8/19, 1:00:52 PM] Yi Kai: Yah
[24/8/19, 1:00:56 PM] Yi Kai: That's why it's so hard
[24/8/19, 1:01:00 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: if u see wenhao do it it lookd better
[24/8/19, 1:01:20 PM] Yi Kai: For wenhao the does the pen turn 180 after the end
[24/8/19, 1:01:33 PM] Yi Kai: 'Cause if the tip is at a different side of the hand it's not really right liao
[24/8/19, 1:01:55 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: whats the does the
[24/8/19, 1:02:00 PM] Yi Kai: And tbh I realised my triple is only doable with my pilot pen, if I change pen I need practice like 10 minutes first
[24/8/19, 1:02:14 PM] Yi Kai: Remove the first the

For wenhao does the...
[24/8/19, 1:02:18 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: lol im doing everything on a pilot pen
[24/8/19, 1:02:25 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oh
[24/8/19, 1:02:44 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: everytime i just accidentally do the one i always do instead
[24/8/19, 1:02:52 PM] Yi Kai: juice up 0.4 is not bad 'cause it's heavy
[24/8/19, 1:03:12 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: idh that pen
[24/8/19, 1:03:20 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: pilot g2 is a bit short though
[24/8/19, 1:03:35 PM] Yi Kai: Someone give me one
[24/8/19, 1:03:49 PM] Yi Kai: Depends on what tricks you do
[24/8/19, 1:04:11 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: for sonic my middle finger just instictively straightens
[24/8/19, 1:04:54 PM] Yi Kai: Yah
[24/8/19, 1:05:08 PM] Yi Kai: And when I do bend down, the pen just flies away 'cause can't catch
[24/8/19, 1:05:32 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: u need to bring ur index and ring finger together
[24/8/19, 1:05:42 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: usually if i get the middle finger to bend it will succeed
[24/8/19, 1:05:58 PM] Yi Kai: Yah that's the thing
[24/8/19, 1:06:59 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: idk if im letting the pen spin too fast
[24/8/19, 1:07:14 PM] Yi Kai: Sonic?
[24/8/19, 1:07:20 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ya
[24/8/19, 1:07:45 PM] Yi Kai: Anyway it turns out my way of doing thumbspin is v unusual
[24/8/19, 1:07:48 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: cus it means i need to bend my middle finger v fast
[24/8/19, 1:07:53 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: lol why
[24/8/19, 1:08:14 PM] Yi Kai: I wentt to look up tutorials, most do it your way if closing the index so that it doesn't go to catching position
[24/8/19, 1:08:20 PM] Yi Kai: But I just open my hand wide
[24/8/19, 1:08:49 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: wdym catching position
[24/8/19, 1:09:01 PM] Yi Kai: So that it doesn't spin into the index
[24/8/19, 1:09:25 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: my index goes out
[24/8/19, 1:09:34 PM] Yi Kai: Oh
[24/8/19, 1:09:39 PM] Yi Kai: And middle goes in?
[24/8/19, 1:09:40 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: and i wait for the pen to naturally fall in
[24/8/19, 1:09:43 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oops
[24/8/19, 1:09:53 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: middle is below the thumb whay
[24/8/19, 1:09:55 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: what*
[24/8/19, 1:10:00 PM] Yi Kai: For me I kinda make it fall a bit when I feel it's going to drop
[24/8/19, 1:10:07 PM] Yi Kai: Mine isn't
[24/8/19, 1:10:14 PM] Yi Kai: For me, after I push I stretch out my hand one
[24/8/19, 1:10:23 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oh
[24/8/19, 1:10:33 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: if i do that the pen just falls from the thumb cause no support
[24/8/19, 1:10:35 PM] Yi Kai: Including my ring and pinky
[24/8/19, 1:10:40 PM] Yi Kai: Oh
[24/8/19, 1:10:55 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: is double and triple thumbaround based on balancing the pen on ur thumb even a legit trick
[24/8/19, 1:10:56 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: lol
[24/8/19, 1:11:04 PM] Yi Kai: Yes
[24/8/19, 1:11:08 PM] Yi Kai: It's called a thumbspin
[24/8/19, 1:11:12 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: everytime i google its just yuxings way
[24/8/19, 1:11:15 PM] Yi Kai: Known record is 23.0 spin
[24/8/19, 1:11:16 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ph
[24/8/19, 1:11:17 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oh
[24/8/19, 1:11:21 PM] Yi Kai: Wdym
[24/8/19, 1:11:22 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i qanna watch that
[24/8/19, 1:11:29 PM] Yi Kai: Just search thumbspin world record
[24/8/19, 1:11:36 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: the one where u kind of toss up into the air
[24/8/19, 1:11:51 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: the one u tried to do in the library when he brought his spinning pen
[24/8/19, 1:11:51 PM] Yi Kai: What the
[24/8/19, 1:11:58 PM] Yi Kai: Oh that thing
[24/8/19, 1:12:21 PM] Yi Kai: The one where you just hold out your index and just keep spinning non-stop?
[24/8/19, 1:12:42 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: https://youtu.be/C7hrlS1lUmo
[24/8/19, 1:12:44 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: holy shit
[24/8/19, 1:12:51 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ya
[24/8/19, 1:13:14 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: then u have guanlin trying to do the same trick but holding out the thumb instead
[24/8/19, 1:14:29 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: im pretty sure if u use a normal writing pen u cant even go past 10
[24/8/19, 1:15:54 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: https://youtu.be/LAKsP2x0s-E

wth
[24/8/19, 1:18:42 PM] Yi Kai: Well my record is 3.5
[24/8/19, 1:19:24 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: https://youtu.be/45_zhEEJ1Ys

what is this
[24/8/19, 1:19:33 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: do a 4!
[24/8/19, 1:30:36 PM] Yi Kai: Dk
[24/8/19, 1:30:52 PM] Yi Kai: I think he flexing he did 1.5 50 times in a row?
[24/8/19, 1:30:55 PM] Yi Kai: Which I also can

This one is retarded
[24/8/19, 1:59:32 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: lol
[24/8/19, 1:59:47 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: its continuous
[24/8/19, 2:01:45 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: lol @the fries one
[24/8/19, 6:03:36 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: where is the pop video and picturess
[24/8/19, 6:03:37 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: wth
[24/8/19, 8:50:07 PM] Yi Kai: Welcome to b51
[24/8/19, 8:51:56 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: LOL
[24/8/19, 8:52:11 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: yesterdays pop was so scam
[24/8/19, 9:05:32 PM] Yi Kai: Exactly
[24/8/19, 9:05:52 PM] Yi Kai: Do you have the list of their emails, I feel like blackmailing them siah
[24/8/19, 9:06:22 PM] Yi Kai: Their OTs all copy our year document and stuff almost exactly
[24/8/19, 9:07:14 PM] Yi Kai: And if they had actual issues with the video I’m fine, but the way he emphasised it is like telling everyone the video actually not done
[24/8/19, 9:07:38 PM] Yi Kai: Like honestly there’s no organisation needed for yesterday’s POP
[24/8/19, 9:07:38 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: lol its in exco dropbox
[24/8/19, 9:08:07 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i mean actual issues can be resolved if they didnt do the video last minute
[24/8/19, 9:08:11 PM] Yi Kai: Parade copy paste

Slides 5 minutes (plus theme is trash)

Video non-existent

Refreshments maybe need more time for catering
[24/8/19, 9:08:15 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: apparently they couldnt export the video but thats dumb
[24/8/19, 9:08:19 PM] Yi Kai: That’s also true
[24/8/19, 9:08:31 PM] Yi Kai: Didn’t I tell you that?
[24/8/19, 9:08:41 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i rmb someone told me that
[24/8/19, 9:08:47 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: idk if it was u or yik jin
[24/8/19, 9:08:51 PM] Yi Kai: Zong Nan tell me one
[24/8/19, 9:08:56 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oh
[24/8/19, 9:09:12 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: anyways apparently the video will be out in about 3 hra
[24/8/19, 9:09:16 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: hrs from now*
[24/8/19, 9:09:19 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: according to abner
[24/8/19, 9:09:26 PM] Yi Kai: Wow...
[24/8/19, 9:09:35 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: gg
[24/8/19, 9:09:43 PM] Yi Kai: Tbh back then zoren tanked
[24/8/19, 9:10:04 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i didnt even do much
[24/8/19, 9:11:53 PM] Yi Kai: They haven’t published photos right?
[24/8/19, 9:17:10 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: yess
[24/8/19, 9:17:15 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: can we 催 them

[24/8/19, 9:17:34 PM] Yi Kai: And today IUDC
[24/8/19, 9:17:59 PM] Yi Kai: Why're you in contact with abner though
[24/8/19, 9:18:03 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i slap him
[24/8/19, 9:18:11 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: fuxiang is the source
[24/8/19, 9:18:16 PM] Yi Kai: Oh
[24/8/19, 9:32:10 PM] Yi Kai: Just realised I yesterday never tap card
[24/8/19, 9:32:39 PM] Yi Kai: 'Cause my parents fetched me to school ('cause I a bit sick + bringing full u)

So I forgot the existence of tapping card
[24/8/19, 9:34:38 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oops
[24/8/19, 9:34:45 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: tbh i dont think anyone remembers anymore
[24/8/19, 9:44:04 PM] Yi Kai: Lol
[24/8/19, 9:44:14 PM] Yi Kai: And now it feels so weird to ask Ng to help me 'cause of that
[24/8/19, 9:53:55 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: why
[24/8/19, 9:54:00 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: and physics practical need revise last year stuff?
[24/8/19, 9:55:45 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: Uhh I think I’ll send it tomorrow Reyes’s voice suddenly became super deep
[24/8/19, 9:55:50 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ok can
[24/8/19, 9:56:23 PM] Yi Kai: Probably
[24/8/19, 9:56:30 PM] Yi Kai: Who send one?
[24/8/19, 9:56:36 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: why tho
[24/8/19, 9:56:39 PM] Yi Kai: And, lmao
[24/8/19, 9:56:40 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: probably abner
[24/8/19, 9:56:45 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: fuziang forwarded it
[24/8/19, 9:56:51 PM] Yi Kai: But not that much stuff what
[24/8/19, 9:56:54 PM] Yi Kai: What you want revise
[24/8/19, 9:57:01 PM] Yi Kai: Cannot remember meh?
[24/8/19, 9:57:05 PM] Yi Kai: Oh
[24/8/19, 9:57:15 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i dun rmb what we did last year
[24/8/19, 9:57:27 PM] Yi Kai: The formulas should be enough
[24/8/19, 9:57:30 PM] Yi Kai: Q=mc theta
[24/8/19, 9:57:35 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oh ok
[24/8/19, 9:57:34 PM] Yi Kai: P=VI
[24/8/19, 9:57:43 PM] Yi Kai: KE=0.5 m v^2
[24/8/19, 10:44:30 PM] Yi Kai: I'm so damn satisfied when my bot can finally beat a greedy algo(basically just picks the move that flips most pieces all the time)
[24/8/19, 10:46:06 PM] Yi Kai: But subsequent versions of it got trashed
[24/8/19, 11:14:58 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: hmm
[24/8/19, 11:21:32 PM] Yi Kai: That's why in some papers they let the bot play against searchers to train
[24/8/19, 11:21:51 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: whats searchers
[24/8/19, 11:22:00 PM] Yi Kai: And frankly if the result of all this turns out trash, I'll just code out a searcher
[24/8/19, 11:22:29 PM] Yi Kai: Basically it just brute force searches future moves, assuming both players play optimally
[24/8/19, 11:22:40 PM] Yi Kai: But they have algorithms to optimise it a bit
[24/8/19, 11:36:05 PM] Yi Kai: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSQNi5sAwuc

OMG
[24/8/19, 11:38:16 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: wait whats the diff for ur ai
[24/8/19, 11:38:40 PM] Yi Kai: I prefer to let it learn from nothing
[24/8/19, 11:39:04 PM] Yi Kai: I used to let it play against itself, but it has some issues (getting stuck at local minima, not sure if you get it)
[24/8/19, 11:39:31 PM] Yi Kai: So I changed the algo to have a population of 20 bots, then they just play 20*21/2 games against one another
[24/8/19, 11:39:39 PM] Yi Kai: It's called genetic algorithm
[24/8/19, 11:39:55 PM] Yi Kai: There's a video by two-minute papers about it
[24/8/19, 11:40:32 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: thats so cool
[24/8/19, 11:40:38 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: !
[24/8/19, 11:40:45 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ill watch this later
‎[25/8/19, 1:58:41 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ‎image omitted
[25/8/19, 8:38:08 AM] Yi Kai: Lmao
[25/8/19, 8:39:36 AM] Yi Kai: Where’s it from?
[25/8/19, 10:46:09 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: our pop
[25/8/19, 10:55:25 AM] Yi Kai: Can’t be from POP video right?
[25/8/19, 10:55:40 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: just the pics
[25/8/19, 10:55:48 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: the pop video quality is so trash
[25/8/19, 10:56:00 AM] Yi Kai: Who sent the pics?
[25/8/19, 10:56:11 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oh wait ansel sent to batch 51
[25/8/19, 10:56:13 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: wait i send
[25/8/19, 10:56:23 AM] Yi Kai: Nvm he sent it to pubs also
[25/8/19, 10:56:28 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oh
[25/8/19, 10:56:34 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: send it to our batch chat!
[25/8/19, 11:00:58 AM] Yi Kai: You send
[25/8/19, 11:01:12 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ok fine
[25/8/19, 4:18:38 PM] Yi Kai: Wait you gonna dao commencement dinner?
[25/8/19, 4:18:42 PM] Yi Kai: 'Cause teachers are going
[25/8/19, 4:18:48 PM] Yi Kai: That's my only consideration
[25/8/19, 4:19:01 PM] Yi Kai: But it ends at 10 and I need wake up at 6 the next day for flight
[25/8/19, 4:19:05 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: whats the diff
[25/8/19, 4:19:13 PM] Yi Kai: It makes a huge diff to me
[25/8/19, 4:19:20 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: why
[25/8/19, 4:20:33 PM] Yi Kai: You won't really see your teachers after going jc
[25/8/19, 4:20:42 PM] Yi Kai: But for peers, most ppl will move on tgt what
[25/8/19, 4:21:16 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: its just 1 night with the teachers what
[25/8/19, 4:21:27 PM] Yi Kai: True
[25/8/19, 4:21:53 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: anyways ill probably still pon
[25/8/19, 4:22:14 PM] Yi Kai: I know you will
[25/8/19, 4:22:37 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: seeing teachers one last time is not worth the money
[25/8/19, 4:23:05 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: idk how much the suit costs but im assuming more than the dinner itself
[25/8/19, 4:27:12 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: lol my.mum alr signed the form
[25/8/19, 4:33:27 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: when u take average u dont have to draw the table right? u can just write average = x1 + x2 + x3 / 3
[25/8/19, 4:34:41 PM] Yi Kai: Well that's because you haven't experienced the pain of regret
[25/8/19, 4:35:10 PM] Yi Kai: If it's just for one value then no need table
[25/8/19, 4:35:27 PM] Yi Kai: But if taking average for a value in the table then draw it out to explicitly show you're taking average
[25/8/19, 4:36:03 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: u have
[25/8/19, 4:36:20 PM] Yi Kai: It's not sth I want to share
[25/8/19, 4:36:26 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oh
[25/8/19, 4:36:42 PM] Yi Kai: Esp because I realised my parents are always suspecting that I have gf one
[25/8/19, 4:36:51 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: wtfork
[25/8/19, 4:37:01 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: lol
[25/8/19, 4:37:29 PM] Yi Kai: Yah so I think you can kinda guess where I'm going at
[25/8/19, 4:37:50 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: still have no idea tbh
[25/8/19, 4:38:04 PM] Yi Kai: ^^
[25/8/19, 4:38:44 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: huh
[25/8/19, 4:38:48 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: do they check ur phone
[25/8/19, 4:39:23 PM] Yi Kai: No
[25/8/19, 4:39:34 PM] Yi Kai: But my sis tells me about their gossip
[25/8/19, 4:40:10 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i thought like they check ur phone so u prefer not to talk abt whatevet ure talking abt
[25/8/19, 4:40:23 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: but anyways literally no one has a gf
[25/8/19, 4:40:27 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: except bernard
[25/8/19, 4:40:41 PM] Yi Kai: Yah
[25/8/19, 5:02:43 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: how to determine whether the relationship is linear or exponential
[25/8/19, 5:04:21 PM] Yi Kai: Like what
[25/8/19, 5:04:50 PM] Yi Kai: Just say plot a graph, and say if relationship is linear or increases with an increasing gradient with respect to (x or sth)
[25/8/19, 5:05:25 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: but then i thought u need to state whether ure doing the steps 6 or 8 times
[25/8/19, 5:05:28 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: in planning procedure
[25/8/19, 5:05:35 PM] Yi Kai: Use theory lorh
[25/8/19, 5:05:48 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: how
[25/8/19, 5:06:06 PM] Yi Kai: Like what can't be solved with theory?
[25/8/19, 5:06:24 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: what if i have 0 theory
[25/8/19, 5:06:33 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: or should u always linearise
[25/8/19, 5:06:56 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: but its not always possible to linearise right
[25/8/19, 5:07:03 PM] Yi Kai: It is
[25/8/19, 5:07:05 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: like heat loss will make it a curve
[25/8/19, 5:07:05 PM] Yi Kai: Linear law
[25/8/19, 5:07:18 PM] Yi Kai: Ok fine if you consider error
[25/8/19, 5:07:38 PM] Yi Kai: But if you can always linearise, easier to determine relationship and extrapolate and stuff
[25/8/19, 5:08:09 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: so if u linearise u only need 6 values?
[25/8/19, 5:10:35 PM] Yi Kai: Yes
[25/8/19, 5:10:44 PM] Yi Kai: OMG OMG

I actually lost to my bot for the first time
[25/8/19, 5:11:01 PM] Yi Kai: I feel so good
[25/8/19, 5:12:20 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: cus ure trash
[25/8/19, 5:12:21 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: jk
[25/8/19, 5:12:31 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: how do u play against it
[25/8/19, 5:13:56 PM] Yi Kai: Just play lorh
[25/8/19, 5:14:19 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: do u plug it into an app
[25/8/19, 5:14:29 PM] Yi Kai: No lah
[25/8/19, 5:14:34 PM] Yi Kai: I coded the interface myself
[25/8/19, 5:14:39 PM] Yi Kai: That was like my first step
[25/8/19, 5:14:43 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oh
[25/8/19, 5:19:07 PM] Yi Kai: Now I'm starting to think maybe I could rek Yong Kang
[25/8/19, 5:19:18 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: is he even that good
[25/8/19, 5:19:32 PM] Yi Kai: And usually papers do over 160 generations
[25/8/19, 5:19:42 PM] Yi Kai: I do 160 generations*

Paper do 1000
[25/8/19, 5:19:51 PM] Yi Kai: No, that's why I so salty about losing
[25/8/19, 5:20:01 PM] Yi Kai: Mainly 'cause he looked up the strats and openings
[25/8/19, 5:20:08 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: wat generation
[25/8/19, 5:20:13 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oh
[25/8/19, 5:20:17 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i just anyhiw play tbh
[25/8/19, 5:20:31 PM] Yi Kai: Genetic algorithm
[25/8/19, 5:20:47 PM] Yi Kai: https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwjy2czr2J3kAhUKrI8KHQ5HA2cQtwIwAHoECAsQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DziMHaGQJuSI%26vl%3Den&usg=AOvVaw133bjsLDXmaRvKBy0dZcZ9

[25/8/19, 5:21:50 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oh
[25/8/19, 5:21:56 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: why not do 1000
[25/8/19, 5:22:05 PM] Yi Kai: Well then I guess my next step is to improve the user-interface
[25/8/19, 5:22:16 PM] Yi Kai: Perhaps 'cause 1 generation takes about 1 minute + to generate
[25/8/19, 5:22:29 PM] Yi Kai: And heats up my com while burning battery
[25/8/19, 5:22:41 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: its just 16 hours!
[25/8/19, 5:22:53 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: no biggie!
[25/8/19, 5:23:25 PM] Yi Kai: My com will overheat like siao
[25/8/19, 5:23:34 PM] Yi Kai: ...
[25/8/19, 5:24:41 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: what does generations do
[25/8/19, 5:25:15 PM] Yi Kai: Improve from the previous generation
[25/8/19, 5:26:11 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ure referring to the ai right
[25/8/19, 5:26:23 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: not every decision it makes
[25/8/19, 5:26:40 PM] Yi Kai: Yes ai
[25/8/19, 5:26:41 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: or is the decisionmaking instant
[25/8/19, 5:26:55 PM] Yi Kai: Just go and watch this
[25/8/19, 5:27:36 PM] Yi Kai: Aiyah I should have saved the version I lost to, now I can't find it
[25/8/19, 5:31:17 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: lol

[26/8/19, 6:00:53 AM] Yi Kai: Wow...
[26/8/19, 10:16:55 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: what is the conclusion of planning based on
[26/8/19, 10:17:04 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: is it based on ur prediction of the shape of the graph
[26/8/19, 10:17:58 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: cus if u say "if it is a straight line graph passing thru origin, x is directly proportional to y", u can also say the same thing if u twist the condition
[26/8/19, 10:18:59 PM] Yi Kai: ?
[26/8/19, 10:19:04 PM] Yi Kai: Just see what's the aim lah
[26/8/19, 10:19:14 PM] Yi Kai: If the aim is determine relationship then say plot graph enough what
[26/8/19, 10:19:29 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: no what i thought u need a conclusion
[26/8/19, 10:19:39 PM] Yi Kai: Planning?!?!
[26/8/19, 10:19:42 PM] Yi Kai: Doubt it
[26/8/19, 10:20:12 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: as in some have conclusion some dun have

[26/8/19, 10:21:14 PM] Yi Kai: That's chem lah bro
[26/8/19, 10:21:18 PM] Yi Kai: I thought you saying physics
[26/8/19, 10:21:28 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: thats physics
[26/8/19, 10:21:47 PM] Yi Kai: What's the question?
[26/8/19, 10:22:26 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: pendulum bob relationship between time taken for amplitude to decrease and mass of bob
[26/8/19, 10:23:47 PM] Yi Kai: Can't you say plot graph?
[26/8/19, 10:24:03 PM] Yi Kai: Oh you linear lawed it?
[26/8/19, 10:24:06 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i say alr
[26/8/19, 10:24:16 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: dont need what
[26/8/19, 10:24:27 PM] Yi Kai: Asking if you did, not whether need
[26/8/19, 10:24:39 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i did not
[26/8/19, 10:24:48 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: nvm
[26/8/19, 10:25:41 PM] Yi Kai: Wait so what's wrong?
[26/8/19, 11:21:32 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: just see wat the q asks
[26/8/19, 11:22:26 PM] Yi Kai: Ok
[26/8/19, 11:25:16 PM] Yi Kai: Just bring calculator, long ruler, sharp pencil, pen eraser, enough liao right?
[26/8/19, 11:25:25 PM] Yi Kai: pen and eraser are separate*
[26/8/19, 11:25:47 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: correction taape
[26/8/19, 11:26:00 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: protractor if u want
[26/8/19, 11:26:03 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: but yes
[26/8/19, 11:26:12 PM] Yi Kai: Protractor for what
[26/8/19, 11:26:18 PM] Yi Kai: Correction tape I have
[26/8/19, 11:26:27 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: in case need
[26/8/19, 11:26:38 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i mean probably will provide if need
[26/8/19, 11:26:40 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: but still
[27/8/19, 7:41:37 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: modifications wont be tested right
[27/8/19, 8:01:17 PM] Yi Kai: I just tried duckduckgo and actually found it decent
[27/8/19, 8:01:34 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: whats that
[27/8/19, 8:01:37 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: is that the search engine
[27/8/19, 8:02:15 PM] Yi Kai: Yah
[27/8/19, 8:02:22 PM] Yi Kai: 'Cause to me bing is trash
[27/8/19, 8:02:32 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: whats the difference tho
[27/8/19, 8:02:36 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: between ddg and google
[27/8/19, 8:06:26 PM] Yi Kai: ddg claims they don't steal data
[27/8/19, 8:06:44 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: 🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔
[27/8/19, 8:07:04 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: greenwashing
[27/8/19, 8:08:36 PM] Yi Kai: Anyway I realised my topic not that hard
[27/8/19, 8:08:51 PM] Yi Kai: Just need to search through enough sites and the answers will come
[27/8/19, 8:39:15 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: lol
[27/8/19, 8:39:29 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: have u done el compre

[27/8/19, 8:50:54 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oops
[27/8/19, 9:43:52 PM] Yi Kai: Bernard's instagram profile pic is actually so meme
[27/8/19, 9:49:59 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: LOL
[27/8/19, 9:50:41 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: it has been like this for some time
[28/8/19, 7:05:52 AM] Yi Kai: This CCA T-shirt thing is so scam
[28/8/19, 7:06:03 AM] Yi Kai: Most people literally just wear PE T-shirt
[28/8/19, 7:06:22 AM] Yi Kai: Like they should say if no CCA T-shirt then wear school u right
[28/8/19, 7:06:35 AM] Yi Kai: Cause my PE is L, my batch tee is M so a bit tight
[28/8/19, 7:08:08 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i mean this is unfair to those who really dont have a cca shirt
[28/8/19, 7:08:18 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: its just those who are not following the rules
[28/8/19, 7:08:39 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: mine is a bit small also
[28/8/19, 7:08:56 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: even though both my pe and batch is s
[28/8/19, 9:38:22 PM] Yi Kai: Tbh the POP video is so damn trash
[28/8/19, 9:38:36 PM] Yi Kai: Like if they do it late and it's v good not too bad
[28/8/19, 9:39:09 PM] Yi Kai: But then it's so trash, it's just a freakin video montage. Like not even a single captioned meme of sorts. Like wth
[28/8/19, 9:47:47 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: lol yeah
[28/8/19, 9:47:56 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: the dedications are quite meaningless they are just fooling around
[28/8/19, 9:48:06 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: and some peoples faces arent even in the video
[28/8/19, 9:48:26 PM] Yi Kai: Tbh can't be that meaningful
[28/8/19, 9:48:30 PM] Yi Kai: Such as mine
[28/8/19, 9:48:42 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: at least they can have a message right
[28/8/19, 9:48:49 PM] Yi Kai: Or at least I was just skipping through the video
[28/8/19, 9:48:53 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: whats the point of showing themselves playing scissors paper stone
[28/8/19, 9:49:04 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: a lot of peoples arent there
[28/8/19, 9:49:05 PM] Yi Kai: True
[28/8/19, 9:49:24 PM] Yi Kai: But 51's dedications are fine if you ask me
[28/8/19, 9:49:32 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: yeah
[28/8/19, 9:49:38 PM] Yi Kai: Perhaps 'cause they can't find photos
[28/8/19, 9:49:39 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: its 52's ones
[28/8/19, 9:49:55 PM] Yi Kai: People like John are just retarded if you ask me
[28/8/19, 9:49:58 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: the photos they found are just cropped images of group photos anyways
[28/8/19, 9:50:06 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: might as well cut out everyones face and paste it in the video
[28/8/19, 9:50:12 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: whar did john do
[28/8/19, 9:50:13 PM] Yi Kai: It's like he acts like some 8-year old child running around
[28/8/19, 9:50:20 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: lol
[28/8/19, 9:50:31 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i skipped through 52s clips
[28/8/19, 9:50:42 PM] Yi Kai: I skipped through the whole vid
[28/8/19, 9:50:57 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: u just watched it?
[28/8/19, 9:51:08 PM] Yi Kai: Like during unit camp, as his buddy, it's always difficult to find him 'cause he will always just run everywhere
[28/8/19, 9:51:14 PM] Yi Kai: Some time ago lah
[28/8/19, 9:51:19 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: LOL
[28/8/19, 9:51:37 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i thought we screwed up for last year pop
[28/8/19, 9:51:41 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: but this is worse tbh
[28/8/19, 9:51:46 PM] Yi Kai: Anyway Jennywong want meet me and I tomorrow afternoon got dental so we agreed on tomorrow bio period lol
[28/8/19, 9:51:50 PM] Yi Kai: True
[28/8/19, 9:51:54 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: meet for wat
[28/8/19, 9:52:03 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: remedial?
[28/8/19, 9:52:08 PM] Yi Kai: My compre worst in class
[28/8/19, 9:52:11 PM] Yi Kai: Tied with simin
[28/8/19, 9:52:14 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oh
[28/8/19, 9:52:24 PM] Yi Kai: That's how I see it 'cause that was how my sec 2 remedial sessions went
[28/8/19, 9:52:47 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: should i do chem or ses for bio
[28/8/19, 9:54:50 PM] Yi Kai: ses
[28/8/19, 9:54:55 PM] Yi Kai: What you want do for chem?
[28/8/19, 10:01:28 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: mug the pract lor
[28/8/19, 10:01:33 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: later she burn me again
[28/8/19, 10:02:32 PM] Yi Kai: Lol
[28/8/19, 10:08:36 PM] Yi Kai: The most memorable thing is that for reflections during unit camp, he wrote "Beware of the dementors" that sort of thing
[28/8/19, 10:16:38 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: lol
[29/8/19, 3:49:19 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: lol i found my pilot g2 on my sofa
[29/8/19, 3:49:28 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i think i forgot to keep it when i took it out to spin yesterday
[29/8/19, 4:54:30 PM] Yi Kai: Lmao
[29/8/19, 4:54:32 PM] Yi Kai: Wth
[29/8/19, 8:37:24 PM] Yi Kai: My successor is such a disappointment
[29/8/19, 8:37:30 PM] Yi Kai: 1 week in and he hasn't touched the website
[29/8/19, 8:42:40 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: LOL
[29/8/19, 8:42:50 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: did he just keep saying ok when u ask
[29/8/19, 8:42:58 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: just leave it its their responsibility now
[29/8/19, 8:48:20 PM] Yi Kai: Or like sure I will do it soon
[29/8/19, 8:48:33 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: at most he gets rekt
[29/8/19, 8:51:49 PM] Yi Kai: yah
[29/8/19, 8:51:56 PM] Yi Kai: But then b49 also tell me about it
[29/8/19, 8:51:58 PM] Yi Kai: So i v sien
[29/8/19, 8:52:39 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: wdym
[29/8/19, 8:56:28 PM] Yi Kai: Wah lao english is so hard
[29/8/19, 8:58:09 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: u prepping ah
[29/8/19, 8:58:15 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i thought u say the points can find one
[29/8/19, 9:03:07 PM] Yi Kai: Until I realise there's like 几十个 link
[29/8/19, 9:03:59 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ew
[29/8/19, 9:04:06 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i lazy to prep tbh
[29/8/19, 9:04:08 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i rather do ses
[29/8/19, 9:04:09 PM] Yi Kai: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NciuIG_ndY85g3uLejB83mAKbcf90oMcacpgDsraZqY/edit
[29/8/19, 9:04:13 PM] Yi Kai: Unless it was sent last year
[29/8/19, 9:04:17 PM] Yi Kai: Aiyah ses v easy one
[29/8/19, 9:04:21 PM] Yi Kai: Just do after chem prac
[29/8/19, 9:04:31 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: wth
[29/8/19, 9:04:45 PM] Yi Kai: Everyone's online on that doc
[29/8/19, 9:05:33 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: f
[29/8/19, 9:05:43 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: all the links no title must click one byone ah
[29/8/19, 9:08:21 PM] Yi Kai: She grouped them
[29/8/19, 9:08:39 PM] Yi Kai: On com if you hover, can get the title if it's linked to another doc
[29/8/19, 9:08:57 PM] Yi Kai: But tbh I vv scared my topic is too off
[29/8/19, 9:09:05 PM] Yi Kai: Our lesson was frankly not v good
[29/8/19, 9:09:18 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: it was ok la
[29/8/19, 9:29:19 PM] Yi Kai: For chem planning is sow gonna post the answers to the enthalpy change one?
[29/8/19, 9:44:53 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: she said she was posting i think
[29/8/19, 9:45:08 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: tmr can wear anything right
[29/8/19, 9:45:26 PM] Yi Kai: Ofc
[29/8/19, 11:27:18 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: wait i cant even tell if the questions are argumentative or expository
[29/8/19, 11:27:36 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: like ure supposed to agree fully or give a balanced viewpoint with diff reasons

[30/8/19, 8:35:58 AM] Yi Kai: ...
[30/8/19, 10:50:31 PM] Yi Kai: Omg

I just changed the structure of my AI and in like the past 1.5 hours it already beat the stuff I trained for double to triple the amount of time
[31/8/19, 12:20:06 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: does it still beat u for the first 3 times
[31/8/19, 9:49:33 AM] Yi Kai: No
[31/8/19, 9:49:48 AM] Yi Kai: I mean it needs time to learn
[31/8/19, 12:56:36 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: https://youtu.be/3BNg4fDJC8A
[31/8/19, 1:09:53 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: https://youtu.be/JhYZy1ugI3Q
[31/8/19, 8:55:45 PM] Yi Kai: Can we get our papers done by tuesday
[31/8/19, 8:55:52 PM] Yi Kai: Then we cross-check on wed
[31/8/19, 8:56:07 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: wed?
[31/8/19, 8:56:22 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: when we dismissed ah
[31/8/19, 9:17:11 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: hello
[31/8/19, 9:17:14 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: but yes ok
[31/8/19, 9:18:06 PM] Yi Kai: ?

Not sure if chen is doing his lesson as usual
[31/8/19, 9:18:25 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i thought we dismissed early cus bio pract
[31/8/19, 9:18:30 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: whats the use of that tbh
[31/8/19, 9:18:33 PM] Yi Kai: Sorry I blueticked by accident and didn't read the message at all so I don't know
[31/8/19, 9:18:43 PM] Yi Kai: true

But i need physics to do my fa
[31/8/19, 9:18:44 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: its fine
[31/8/19, 9:19:04 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: but then if chen does his lesson then we have no time to do the fas
[31/8/19, 9:19:05 PM] Yi Kai: Anyway you're dept head so got the exco briefing thing whât
[31/8/19, 9:19:14 PM] Yi Kai: 勉强
[31/8/19, 9:19:23 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i hope bryan decides that only div chair needs to go
[31/8/19, 9:19:35 PM] Yi Kai: ...
[31/8/19, 9:19:57 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: if not theyre like activating 10 ppl for the briefing
[31/8/19, 9:20:08 PM] Yi Kai: Yah
[31/8/19, 9:20:23 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: hows ur progress with the report
[31/8/19, 9:20:50 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i havent done it but im guessing idk how to conclude
[31/8/19, 9:22:02 PM] Yi Kai: I already have 1050 words around there so I'm gonna conclude
[31/8/19, 9:22:07 PM] Yi Kai: I have 2 pros and 2 cons so far
[31/8/19, 9:22:19 PM] Yi Kai: I thinking of changing to like more pros than cons yeh know
[31/8/19, 9:22:27 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: lol
[31/8/19, 9:22:40 PM] Yi Kai: Like 'cause I talked about negative impacts, if not I think I'm supposed to just argue against my own points
[31/8/19, 9:22:44 PM] Yi Kai: Which is kinda hard
[31/8/19, 9:22:47 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i have more towards does not proliferate than proliferate
[31/8/19, 9:23:21 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: huh ur conclusion is 450 words
[31/8/19, 9:24:45 PM] Yi Kai: I'll use about 200 words I think, each point is about 200 words for me
[31/8/19, 9:24:59 PM] Yi Kai: If I conclude + 1 more point may not have enough words
[31/8/19, 9:25:10 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oo ok
[31/8/19, 9:25:11 PM] Yi Kai: Also, it doesn't really matter if I don't hit 1400
[31/8/19, 9:25:15 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: how many references do u have
[31/8/19, 9:25:21 PM] Yi Kai: I don't know, doing references last
[31/8/19, 9:25:34 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: did u use a lot of different sources tho
[31/8/19, 9:25:35 PM] Yi Kai: Learning from my project mentor last year: "References v easy one, just leave it last"
[31/8/19, 9:25:39 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: mine is quite limited for now
[31/8/19, 9:25:45 PM] Yi Kai: Mostly websites
[31/8/19, 9:26:09 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: but then its easier to put in while ure doing it rather than trying to recall what u used
[31/8/19, 9:26:14 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oh
[31/8/19, 9:26:20 PM] Yi Kai: Did you know that the plastic straw ban thing started in 2011 when some kid found straws a waste and proposed to the coffee shop to ask people whether they want it first
[31/8/19, 9:26:26 PM] Yi Kai: https://www.thedailybeast.com/this-kid-single-handedly-launched-the-plastic-straw-ban-movement?ref=scroll
[31/8/19, 9:26:35 PM] Yi Kai: I just comment the link first
[31/8/19, 9:26:48 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i didnt know it was so long ago
[31/8/19, 9:27:31 PM] Yi Kai: Usually when I search they say its about a video of some marine life which died due to plastic straws
[31/8/19, 9:28:26 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i dont think it came to singapore until recently though
[31/8/19, 9:28:42 PM] Yi Kai: True
[31/8/19, 9:28:49 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: or maybe just big corporations like mcdonalds doing it made it much more famous than it was last time
[31/8/19, 9:28:55 PM] Yi Kai: Yah lah
[31/8/19, 9:29:09 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: but then thye still provide the straws so idk whats the point
[31/8/19, 9:29:39 PM] Yi Kai: It's like the towels thing what
[31/8/19, 9:29:43 PM] Yi Kai: They still wash it for you
[31/8/19, 9:30:17 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: true but then kfc they really dont give u the straws
[31/8/19, 9:30:30 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i mean if its there most people will take it out of convenience i guess
[31/8/19, 9:30:42 PM] Yi Kai: Unless you ask
[31/8/19, 9:30:50 PM] Yi Kai: As in for a start lah
[31/8/19, 9:31:05 PM] Yi Kai: Tbh kfc coke in their paper cup without straws is just trash
[31/8/19, 9:31:15 PM] Yi Kai: The ice and the coke is literally pressing against your lip
[31/8/19, 9:31:32 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: true
[31/8/19, 10:14:50 PM] Yi Kai: Kinda finished it, just left with citations
[31/8/19, 10:14:56 PM] Yi Kai: At least I exceeded 1400 words
[31/8/19, 10:51:40 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: thats good
[1/9/19, 2:42:48 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: how many FAs are u planning to do on wed
[1/9/19, 2:42:52 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: everything?
[1/9/19, 2:43:02 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: if not we need to come back during sep holidays
[1/9/19, 3:10:10 PM] Yi Kai: All
[1/9/19, 3:10:13 PM] Yi Kai: Yah
[1/9/19, 3:10:27 PM] Yi Kai: Aiyah I don’t think Chen will carry out his lesson anyway
[1/9/19, 3:11:35 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ya
[1/9/19, 3:11:41 PM] Yi Kai: Just do lorh
[1/9/19, 3:11:50 PM] Yi Kai: Anyway I don’t think need 15 minutes on everything
[1/9/19, 3:11:58 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: im pretty sure last year they paid $2 each for plaque
[1/9/19, 3:12:03 PM] Yi Kai: Shh
[1/9/19, 3:12:10 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: 0.o
[1/9/19, 3:12:13 PM] Yi Kai: It’s called negotiation techniques
[1/9/19, 3:12:20 PM] Yi Kai: Although I doubt they’ll do stuff
[1/9/19, 3:12:24 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: but the price is alr there
[1/9/19, 3:12:36 PM] Yi Kai: Make them feel more bad yeh know

Like esp considering that the POP was so damn trash
[1/9/19, 3:12:45 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: what did u do during physics lock up ah
[1/9/19, 3:12:48 PM] Yi Kai: Not a single meme on the video
[1/9/19, 3:12:52 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: it was so trash
[1/9/19, 3:13:01 PM] Yi Kai: I wanted to do jennywong compre but couldn't concentrate
[1/9/19, 3:13:04 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: the video is 3 days late and still bad
[1/9/19, 3:13:11 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: LOL same
[1/9/19, 3:13:11 PM] Yi Kai: So I ended up playing werewolf with weisheng they all
[1/9/19, 3:13:16 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i ended up playing hangman
[1/9/19, 3:13:21 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ee
[1/9/19, 3:13:21 PM] Yi Kai: They DIYed the cards
[1/9/19, 3:13:23 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: bojio
[1/9/19, 3:13:32 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ask jiaquan bring lor
[1/9/19, 3:13:32 PM] Yi Kai: 👌
[1/9/19, 3:13:45 PM] Yi Kai: Last week he said he needed to do OTOT so he didn't bring
[1/9/19, 3:13:53 PM] Yi Kai: Considering he didn't start as of then
[1/9/19, 3:13:59 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oh
[1/9/19, 3:14:25 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i didnt even see u during physics lock up
[1/9/19, 3:16:00 PM] Yi Kai: Lol
[1/9/19, 3:16:24 PM] Yi Kai: Aiyah revise chem prac lah
[1/9/19, 3:16:32 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i am
‎[1/9/19, 3:36:00 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ‎image omitted
[1/9/19, 3:37:08 PM] Yi Kai: I also do
[1/9/19, 3:37:11 PM] Yi Kai: Dk*
[1/9/19, 3:39:27 PM] Yi Kai: Honestly for that one I found the table quite useless
[1/9/19, 3:39:57 PM] Yi Kai: But volume of co2 should be before the mass of calcium carbonate right?
[1/9/19, 3:40:15 PM] Yi Kai: By logic
[1/9/19, 3:40:20 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ya but it doesnt make sense either way
[1/9/19, 3:40:38 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: the tabulation of data should just be for data collected for the experiment
[1/9/19, 3:40:53 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: no point putting mass of caco3 when ure calculating it afterwards
[1/9/19, 3:41:02 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: unless u need the mass of caco3 to plot a graph or smth
[1/9/19, 3:41:09 PM] Yi Kai: True
[1/9/19, 3:41:39 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: chem is 1h 50min of continuous pract right
[1/9/19, 3:41:44 PM] Yi Kai: Yep
[1/9/19, 3:41:50 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: my titration always screw up
[1/9/19, 3:42:02 PM] Yi Kai: Same
[1/9/19, 3:42:06 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i get a consistent reading but its like 0.50cm3 from the correct one
[1/9/19, 3:42:14 PM] Yi Kai: Bruh
[1/9/19, 3:42:18 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: then magically when sow told me to empty the burette and fill it again it works
[1/9/19, 3:43:41 PM] Yi Kai: Means never wash enough lah...
[1/9/19, 3:44:56 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: but then i wash like 2 times each with di water and the solution  alr
[1/9/19, 3:45:08 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: when u wash do u cover the hole and shake
[1/9/19, 3:45:34 PM] Yi Kai: Kinda
[1/9/19, 3:45:36 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: the guy in the titration video just let the solution run down
[1/9/19, 3:45:42 PM] Yi Kai: Don't wash with di, just wash with solution
[1/9/19, 3:45:49 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: legit
[1/9/19, 3:45:51 PM] Yi Kai: A bit wasteful of solution lorh
[1/9/19, 3:45:58 PM] Yi Kai: For burette and pipette
[1/9/19, 3:46:04 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: why
[1/9/19, 3:46:10 PM] Yi Kai: What is starch indicator supposed to do ah?
[1/9/19, 3:46:30 PM] Yi Kai: I mean if there's water at the walls, then it'll make the solution more dilute
[1/9/19, 3:46:45 PM] Yi Kai: But if you wash with solution, then this effect not so bad
[1/9/19, 3:46:57 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: no what it doesnt matter does it
[1/9/19, 3:47:03 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: the no of mol is the same
[1/9/19, 3:47:06 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: wait ah
[1/9/19, 3:47:10 PM] Yi Kai: ^
[1/9/19, 3:47:18 PM] Yi Kai: It does
[1/9/19, 3:47:24 PM] Yi Kai: You're told to wash with solution for a reason
[1/9/19, 3:47:29 PM] Yi Kai: For flask wash with di water
[1/9/19, 3:47:50 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: omg
[1/9/19, 3:47:58 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: have i been doing it wrong the whole time
[1/9/19, 3:48:02 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: which pract is it
[1/9/19, 3:48:22 PM] Yi Kai: In general
[1/9/19, 3:48:27 PM] Yi Kai: I'm going through her notes
[1/9/19, 3:48:38 PM] Yi Kai: Then got one on use of indicator say starch turns from dark blue to colourless
[1/9/19, 3:49:04 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: its iodometric titration
[1/9/19, 3:49:31 PM] Yi Kai: Ok
[1/9/19, 3:49:36 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: wait
[1/9/19, 3:49:36 PM] Yi Kai: And how's it work
[1/9/19, 3:51:01 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ok i think
[1/9/19, 3:51:04 PM] Yi Kai: Oh yah and need remember white tile for titration
[1/9/19, 3:51:07 PM] Yi Kai: I never remember it
[1/9/19, 3:51:22 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: theres a iodide containing solution
[1/9/19, 3:51:38 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: then ure supposed to use sodium thiosulfate to liberate the I2 from the solution
[1/9/19, 3:52:10 PM] Yi Kai: Oh
[1/9/19, 3:52:17 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: and then titrate to find the amount of I2 liberated
[1/9/19, 3:52:34 PM] Yi Kai: But how does the starch change when it reacts with I2
[1/9/19, 3:52:35 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: but then the starch is supposed to be added nearing the end of the titration for some reason
[1/9/19, 3:52:45 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: need know meh
[1/9/19, 3:52:45 PM] Yi Kai: Oh yah that thing
[1/9/19, 3:52:53 PM] Yi Kai: As in colour
[1/9/19, 3:53:26 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: colourless to blueblack
[1/9/19, 3:53:50 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i think its cus its difficult to see the colour change of starch at the start
[1/9/19, 3:54:06 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: wait actually it may be the other way
[1/9/19, 3:54:13 PM] Yi Kai: That's why
[1/9/19, 3:54:18 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ya it is
[1/9/19, 3:54:24 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: blueblack to colourless
[1/9/19, 3:54:30 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: starch turns blueblack in presence of i2
[1/9/19, 3:54:35 PM] Yi Kai: So starch is blueblack or what?
[1/9/19, 3:54:39 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: so at the start theres i2 so its blueblack
[1/9/19, 3:54:50 PM] Yi Kai: Ok that makes sense
[1/9/19, 3:54:59 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: starch is colourless before u add it in
[1/9/19, 3:55:08 PM] Yi Kai: Ok
[1/9/19, 3:55:16 PM] Yi Kai: Understooded
[1/9/19, 3:55:18 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: whata the purpose ah
[1/9/19, 3:55:28 PM] Yi Kai: Make the colour change more obvious
[1/9/19, 3:55:31 PM] Yi Kai: Sth along those lines
[1/9/19, 3:55:53 PM] Yi Kai: And if use managanate in burette need say read the top of the meniscus
[1/9/19, 3:56:09 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: but then even if the starch change to colourless u can still see if theres iodine if its brown/yellow what
[1/9/19, 3:56:49 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oh i think its bc
[1/9/19, 3:57:03 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: since the colour of iodine gets fainter and fainter yellow
[1/9/19, 3:57:10 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: its difficult to see the endpoint
[1/9/19, 3:57:24 PM] Yi Kai: ^^
[1/9/19, 3:57:25 PM] Yi Kai: Lol
[1/9/19, 3:57:28 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: so if u add the starch it makes it clearer
[1/9/19, 3:57:31 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oops
[1/9/19, 3:57:58 PM] Yi Kai: Ok rmb what I said about washing pipette and burette?
[1/9/19, 3:58:07 PM] Yi Kai: Supposed to start with tap water, then di water, then solution
[1/9/19, 3:58:08 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: wat
[1/9/19, 3:58:11 PM] Yi Kai: But I'd skip tap water
[1/9/19, 3:58:18 PM] Yi Kai: That's what her notes say
[1/9/19, 3:58:19 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i always skip tap
[1/9/19, 3:58:30 PM] Yi Kai: And only solution is important honestly
[1/9/19, 3:58:37 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ya
[1/9/19, 3:58:49 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: but anyways we shouldnt really need to worry since we r the first shift
[1/9/19, 3:58:55 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: report by 815 right
[1/9/19, 3:58:56 PM] Yi Kai: true
[1/9/19, 3:58:58 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: lt
[1/9/19, 3:59:02 PM] Yi Kai: Just go 8 lah
[1/9/19, 3:59:13 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: did u go to class first
[1/9/19, 3:59:19 PM] Yi Kai: No
[1/9/19, 3:59:21 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oh
[1/9/19, 4:04:19 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: why the iron ii sulfate titration with potassium manganate end point is colourless to faint pink
[1/9/19, 4:04:42 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: wont there be iron iii ions which are nrown
[1/9/19, 4:04:43 PM] Yi Kai: Yah
[1/9/19, 4:04:52 PM] Yi Kai: Managanate more obvious
[1/9/19, 4:05:08 PM] Yi Kai: And since should only have a bit of manganate, so just leave as pink
[1/9/19, 4:05:16 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i thought iron iii is damn intense
[1/9/19, 4:05:23 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: as compared to the pale green of iron ii
[1/9/19, 4:05:58 PM] Yi Kai: i think solution less obvious
[1/9/19, 4:06:44 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: wdym solution
[1/9/19, 4:07:29 PM] Yi Kai: https://chem.libretexts.org/Under_Construction/Walker/Chemicals/Substance_I/Iron(III)_sulfate

Seems like its yellow
[1/9/19, 4:07:34 PM] Yi Kai: After dissolving
[1/9/19, 4:07:44 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ohh
[1/9/19, 4:07:53 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: wait solid is brown ah
[1/9/19, 4:07:55 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ong
[1/9/19, 4:08:09 PM] Yi Kai: ?
[1/9/19, 4:08:37 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: solid iron iii sulfate
[1/9/19, 4:19:44 PM] Yi Kai: It's brown meh?
[1/9/19, 4:31:19 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: idk
[1/9/19, 4:31:19 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: is it
‎[1/9/19, 4:48:36 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ‎image omitted
[1/9/19, 4:57:28 PM] Yi Kai: Yah
[1/9/19, 4:57:34 PM] Yi Kai: Wait what’s tested for redox?
[1/9/19, 4:57:48 PM] Yi Kai: They ask you what’s for the oxidising nature ah?
‎[1/9/19, 5:01:36 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ‎image omitted
[1/9/19, 5:01:47 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: this i guess
[1/9/19, 5:19:38 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: are we given unlimited solution for titration
[1/9/19, 5:20:39 PM] Yi Kai: Think so
[1/9/19, 5:56:56 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: wait the jc gp bulletins do we have to download the individual files in the document with 100203 links
[1/9/19, 5:57:10 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: or do we just save that 1 document
[1/9/19, 6:17:32 PM] Yi Kai: Oh yah crap I forgot about it
[1/9/19, 6:17:38 PM] Yi Kai: ?
[1/9/19, 6:17:46 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: like the stuff in the document
[1/9/19, 6:17:56 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: are all jenny wongs stuff
[1/9/19, 6:18:35 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: so she say turn off sharing is it for all of the stuff or just the collated document
[1/9/19, 7:32:58 PM] Yi Kai: Probably all the stuff
[1/9/19, 7:33:12 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: wth
[1/9/19, 7:38:23 PM] Yi Kai: And I realised my Reversi training was bugged the whole time
[1/9/19, 7:38:37 PM] Yi Kai: Like I fixed it and ran it again
[1/9/19, 7:52:04 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: wdym
[1/9/19, 8:24:51 PM] Yi Kai: Like through the training I realised there’s a bug after 300 generations

Then I fixed it and started the training again from scratch
[1/9/19, 8:51:26 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: does it affect its performance
[1/9/19, 8:51:33 PM] Yi Kai: Yes
[1/9/19, 8:51:35 PM] Yi Kai: A lot
[1/9/19, 8:54:26 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ooo
[1/9/19, 8:54:34 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: may your AI beat yong kang
[1/9/19, 8:56:20 PM] Yi Kai: The best versions I can win by the third round
[1/9/19, 8:56:27 PM] Yi Kai: So must like make it v OP yeh know
[1/9/19, 8:59:23 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: yeet
[1/9/19, 9:42:32 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: omg i just did a 3
[1/9/19, 9:42:35 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: on my nail
[1/9/19, 9:43:10 PM] Yi Kai: Nice
[1/9/19, 9:43:28 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: this is a reflection of good luck ill have for chem pract
[1/9/19, 9:43:36 PM] Yi Kai: ...
[1/9/19, 9:43:40 PM] Yi Kai: I learnt how to do sonic well
[1/9/19, 9:43:55 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i gave up on that
[1/9/19, 9:44:16 PM] Yi Kai: why?
[1/9/19, 9:44:24 PM] Yi Kai: Just practise without the transfer
[1/9/19, 9:44:40 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: double thumbspin is more satisfying
[1/9/19, 10:09:40 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: whats the summary line for kmno4 and ki titration
[1/9/19, 10:09:48 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: theres 2 colour changes
[1/9/19, 10:11:35 PM] Yi Kai: I think just say them one by one
[1/9/19, 10:12:24 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: End point is reached when KI turns from x to x and acidified aqueous KMnO4 turns from x to x
[1/9/19, 10:13:15 PM] Yi Kai: I think
[1/9/19, 10:20:40 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oh ok
[2/9/19, 4:24:29 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: lets check ses tme
[2/9/19, 4:24:30 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: tmr
[2/9/19, 4:24:36 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i should be able to finish it by today

[2/9/19, 4:39:08 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ya ok
[2/9/19, 4:39:22 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: if i finish it before u sleep today we can do this also
‎[3/9/19, 7:13:10 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ‎Untitled • ‎5 pages ‎document omitted
[3/9/19, 5:07:59 PM] Yi Kai: Wow after adding quite a bit more on conclusion I now have 1509 words oops
[3/9/19, 5:18:51 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: its not right there
[3/9/19, 5:20:35 PM] Yi Kai: Lol
[3/9/19, 5:20:41 PM] Yi Kai: Did you click the link?
[3/9/19, 5:20:53 PM] Yi Kai: The space is there whât
[3/9/19, 5:21:07 PM] Yi Kai: Anyway I cut to 1498 just by reading my intro
[3/9/19, 5:21:21 PM] Yi Kai: It’s a nice song that my father cannot stand
[3/9/19, 5:22:19 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ya
[3/9/19, 5:22:25 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: its not jn my phone
[3/9/19, 5:22:28 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: but anyth la
[3/9/19, 5:22:32 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: why
[3/9/19, 5:26:09 PM] Yi Kai: Cause first he hears the high notes which he considers random screaming

Then he hears Big Sean’s rap (not our class’ small Sean) and he doesn’t like any rap although he claims he’s fine with rap
[3/9/19, 5:36:53 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: lmao
[3/9/19, 5:37:07 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: then isnt arianas songs mostly random screaming to him
[3/9/19, 5:38:09 PM] Yi Kai: Yes
[3/9/19, 5:39:39 PM] Yi Kai: Then my Sister likes some random boy band no one ever hears of(why don’t we)
[3/9/19, 5:39:52 PM] Yi Kai: Don’t even get how she discovered it
[3/9/19, 6:14:20 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i think i heard before on spotify
[3/9/19, 6:14:24 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: but dun rmb their songs
[3/9/19, 6:15:46 PM] Yi Kai: I mean like it’s the kind of artist that can get a few songs popular, but the artist isn’t really popular
[3/9/19, 6:16:25 PM] Yi Kai: Like to me I believe that ones success as a celeb is really not so much about skill but more of social media skill
[3/9/19, 7:10:15 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: lol
[3/9/19, 7:10:21 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: advancement of social media leads to the proliferation of the success of celebrities
[3/9/19, 7:10:32 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: when r u submitting ur report
[3/9/19, 8:42:06 PM] Yi Kai: I feel like I’m fine Liao but I don’t want submit

[3/9/19, 8:52:22 PM] Yi Kai: For the prac paper is Ng gonna give answers or sth
[3/9/19, 8:52:31 PM] Yi Kai: 'Cause I did most of paper 2 in purple pen
[3/9/19, 8:52:35 PM] Yi Kai: Until it ran out of ink

[4/9/19, 2:49:54 PM] Yi Kai: Yah true
[4/9/19, 9:56:56 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: #philosophical
[4/9/19, 9:57:11 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: u mean people cant force u to do stuff u dont want to do right
[4/9/19, 9:57:22 PM] Yi Kai: Yes...
[4/9/19, 9:57:42 PM] Yi Kai: Like every time we went ntu to meet mentor last year, he'll try to insist me and junwei wear school u but we'll just dao

[11/9/19, 5:08:13 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: when an acid is weak does it mean only a small proportion of acid molecules will dissociate or does it mean that when the acid has many hydrogens only a few will dissociate for every molecule
[11/9/19, 5:12:30 PM] Yi Kai: Small proportion
[11/9/19, 5:12:41 PM] Yi Kai: So if you react away the acid, more will dissociate
[11/9/19, 5:12:54 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oo
[11/9/19, 5:13:10 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ok thanks

[18/9/19, 6:31:26 AM] Yi Kai: https://aqicn.org/city/singapore/central/

Interesting how a site that takes data from NEA reports about double the PSI NEA reports
[18/9/19, 6:31:47 AM] Yi Kai: I feel like it’s time to go back to stomp and not things like straits times
[18/9/19, 6:43:23 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: 100 is still quite bad though
[18/9/19, 6:43:30 AM] Yi Kai: True
[18/9/19, 6:43:31 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: its 100 according to nea site now
[18/9/19, 6:43:43 AM] Yi Kai: It’s 165 according to aqicn
[18/9/19, 6:44:04 AM] Yi Kai: Maybe that’s why school set the threshold at 90-100
[18/9/19, 6:44:15 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: what website Is that anyways
[18/9/19, 6:44:24 AM] Yi Kai: Like a lot of people don’t trust NEA now
[18/9/19, 6:44:28 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: isn't it 200 or smth
[18/9/19, 6:44:31 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: wth
[18/9/19, 6:44:41 AM] Yi Kai: Is like a site that reports psi for a lot of countries
[18/9/19, 6:44:50 AM] Yi Kai: So when going other countries it’s quite useful
[18/9/19, 6:44:56 AM] Yi Kai: Such as China
[18/9/19, 6:45:06 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: what if it has always been wrong
[18/9/19, 6:45:21 AM] Yi Kai: It seems quite reliable
[18/9/19, 6:45:29 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: that means nea is wront
[18/9/19, 6:45:32 AM] Yi Kai: Who’s always been wrong?
[18/9/19, 6:45:37 AM] Yi Kai: Probably
[18/9/19, 6:45:41 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: the aqicn thing
[18/9/19, 6:45:45 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oops
[18/9/19, 6:45:49 AM] Yi Kai: Weird thing is they take data from NEA
[18/9/19, 6:46:02 AM] Yi Kai: If you go click the link
[18/9/19, 6:46:28 AM] Yi Kai: https://aqicn.org/data-platform/register/
[18/9/19, 6:47:51 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: im confused as to which is correct now
[18/9/19, 6:48:26 AM] Yi Kai: Same
[18/9/19, 6:48:45 AM] Yi Kai: I started questioning it after what Yong Kang said yesterday
[18/9/19, 6:49:18 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: what did he say
[18/9/19, 6:53:27 AM] Yi Kai: He said his relative works for govt
[18/9/19, 6:53:44 AM] Yi Kai: And told him that NEA will reduce the numbers
[18/9/19, 6:53:58 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: wtf
[18/9/19, 6:54:10 AM] Yi Kai: Like there was once it hit 500 and they reported 400(maybe for the newspapers to forward)
[18/9/19, 6:54:15 AM] Yi Kai: So much for POFMA
[18/9/19, 6:54:16 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: so the 400 last time was higher
[18/9/19, 6:54:26 AM] Yi Kai: But for this idc cause either way damn high
[18/9/19, 6:54:26 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: its just satire
[18/9/19, 6:54:36 AM] Yi Kai: Wdym
[18/9/19, 6:54:38 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: its an opinion not a fake news!
[18/9/19, 6:54:46 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: lol true
[18/9/19, 6:54:49 AM] Yi Kai: Maybe, no one will outright tell you that what
[18/9/19, 6:54:54 AM] Yi Kai: ...
[18/9/19, 6:55:10 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: start a movement

[18/9/19, 6:56:09 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: then purify what
[18/9/19, 6:56:10 AM] Yi Kai: Once PSI hit 200, don’t go school

[18/9/19, 6:56:22 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: 2 weeks of study leave pls
[18/9/19, 6:56:43 AM] Yi Kai: Dirty filter better than no filter
[18/9/19, 6:56:45 AM] Yi Kai: Indeed
[18/9/19, 6:56:59 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: no filter cant purify anything
[18/9/19, 6:57:13 AM] Yi Kai: Yah
[18/9/19, 6:57:38 AM] Yi Kai: ‎You deleted this message.
[18/9/19, 6:58:08 AM] Yi Kai: I meant at least there’s purifier just realised

[24/9/19, 9:54:58 PM] Yi Kai: Basically I tripped on the step, then I semi-recovered on right foot

Then at that point I lost balance again, but then my left shoe was off somehow, and I kinda fell on my left toe
[24/9/19, 9:55:26 PM] Yi Kai: So the blue-black is huge, and the doctor just said that if it gets more painful then should do x-ray cause can be slight crack of bone
[24/9/19, 9:55:43 PM] Yi Kai: But tbh I wouldn't 'cause it's damn mafan plus EOY period
[24/9/19, 10:09:17 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i didnt think it was that serious
[24/9/19, 10:09:25 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ow
[24/9/19, 10:09:45 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: idt its something u shld ignore tho
[24/9/19, 10:09:52 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: if it gets more serious that is

[26/9/19, 4:43:59 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: wait for math when u present can u like skip steps
[26/9/19, 4:44:17 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: like instead of factorising and cancelling out some terms u just directly cancel out the terms
[26/9/19, 4:44:24 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: in ur next step
[26/9/19, 5:57:47 AM] Yi Kai: I think can
[26/9/19, 5:58:00 AM] Yi Kai: But if you skip and get wrong then lose both marks
[26/9/19, 6:30:23 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oo ok
‎[26/9/19, 9:52:46 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ‎image omitted
[26/9/19, 9:53:02 PM] Yi Kai: Hang on
[26/9/19, 9:53:10 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: basically the possibilites are Zhang wins 3, Li wins 0
[26/9/19, 9:53:19 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: and then z3 l1 and z3l2
[26/9/19, 9:53:49 PM] Yi Kai: Oh v easy lah
[26/9/19, 9:53:56 PM] Yi Kai: x3 is from 3 choose 1
[26/9/19, 9:54:09 PM] Yi Kai: x6 is 4 choose 2
[26/9/19, 9:54:13 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: but isnt there 4 spaces
[26/9/19, 9:54:18 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: as in 4 choices
[26/9/19, 9:54:22 PM] Yi Kai: For this case, you have 4 games, and 1 guy needs to win once right?
[26/9/19, 9:54:27 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ya
[26/9/19, 9:54:37 PM] Yi Kai: But that guy can't win the last match, 'cause once first person win 3 times end liao
[26/9/19, 9:54:53 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: omg
[26/9/19, 9:54:56 PM] Yi Kai: Same thing for x6
[26/9/19, 9:55:10 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: so smart!
[26/9/19, 9:55:16 PM] Yi Kai: But then bundling that up for a 5 mark question is rather cancer though
[26/9/19, 9:55:19 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: but why is 1 step of working worth 5 marks
[26/9/19, 9:55:19 PM] Yi Kai: 'Cause v easy to miss out
[26/9/19, 9:55:22 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ya exactly
[26/9/19, 9:55:28 PM] Yi Kai: Welcome to probability
[26/9/19, 9:55:50 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: lol higher math is also like this
[26/9/19, 9:55:52 PM] Yi Kai: But usually at most 1 probability question, so can just give away
[26/9/19, 9:56:03 PM] Yi Kai: Actually I can just don't go e-math tbh
[26/9/19, 9:56:28 PM] Yi Kai: And bernard can even just dao chem(since he say he get b4 also overall a1)
[26/9/19, 9:56:53 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: cannottytt give away
[26/9/19, 9:57:12 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: its probably worth like 8 marks
[26/9/19, 9:57:20 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: cap at b3
[26/9/19, 10:09:27 PM] Yi Kai: Well yah
[26/9/19, 10:09:41 PM] Yi Kai: My CT minimum 95% liao what
[26/9/19, 10:10:15 PM] Yi Kai: Can't rmb my t2 score, but not worse than 36 so average out at least 95%
[26/9/19, 10:17:39 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: u got 36
[26/9/19, 10:18:47 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: u need 66.4 for a1
[26/9/19, 10:18:52 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oh wow
[26/9/19, 10:18:56 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: LOL
[26/9/19, 10:21:38 PM] Yi Kai: Then for chem and physics I think I can get 70 for a1, so those 2 I just go for 75
[26/9/19, 10:26:17 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i need 74% for el 73% for ss 70% for chem 75% for physics amath emath
[26/9/19, 10:26:23 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: good meme
[26/9/19, 10:28:29 PM] Yi Kai: Lol
[27/9/19, 9:25:46 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: when drawing without replacement does order matter
[27/9/19, 9:25:59 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: like theres 1 red 2 green and 3 blue balls
[27/9/19, 9:26:36 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: u wanna find the probability of drawing 1 red and 2 green without replacement
[27/9/19, 9:27:13 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: is it 1/6 × 2/5 × 1/4 × (3!÷2!)
[27/9/19, 9:36:10 AM] Yi Kai: Without replacement means after you draw don’t put back?
[27/9/19, 9:36:17 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: yep
[27/9/19, 9:36:29 AM] Yi Kai: No, but you most time’s the 3 choose 2 thing
[27/9/19, 9:36:43 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: why
[27/9/19, 9:36:48 AM] Yi Kai: And for probability as Long as your answer is correct you’ll get full marks
[27/9/19, 9:36:55 AM] Yi Kai: Cause order?
[27/9/19, 9:37:13 AM] Yi Kai: Like if you draw red in the 1st or 3rd draw probability same
[27/9/19, 9:37:19 AM] Yi Kai: But need to count separately
[27/9/19, 9:38:59 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: so the probability is the same no matter the order
[27/9/19, 9:39:10 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: like u get GGR or RGG
[27/9/19, 9:39:13 AM] Yi Kai: Yes
[27/9/19, 9:39:18 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: but then they r separate cases
[27/9/19, 9:39:36 AM] Yi Kai: I lazy to go prove it
[27/9/19, 9:39:43 AM] Yi Kai: But they won’t ask you to prove that
[27/9/19, 9:39:44 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: im damn scared for probability
[27/9/19, 9:39:52 AM] Yi Kai: Go prove it to convince yourself
[27/9/19, 9:40:06 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ok
[27/9/19, 9:40:09 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: what r u revising now
[27/9/19, 9:40:23 AM] Yi Kai: English compre, SS SRQ
[27/9/19, 9:40:40 AM] Yi Kai: Compre just see the wrong stuff and think how to answer, then look at answer
[27/9/19, 9:40:54 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: hmm ok
[27/9/19, 9:41:04 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: at least u dont have to mug math
[27/9/19, 9:41:04 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: lol
[27/9/19, 9:41:19 AM] Yi Kai: Tell me what you’ll Mug for math
[27/9/19, 9:41:32 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: read all the worksheets
[27/9/19, 9:41:35 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: and do the papers
[27/9/19, 9:41:43 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: and do the revision stuff in the google classroom
[27/9/19, 9:41:49 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ill probably do this 1 day before
[27/9/19, 9:41:49 AM] Yi Kai: Learn from maumu and just go through assignments
[27/9/19, 9:42:04 AM] Yi Kai: Dao paper lah
[27/9/19, 9:42:09 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: technixally that works too
[27/9/19, 9:42:13 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: im not u ok
[27/9/19, 9:42:18 AM] Yi Kai: Just do like 1 each until you get 75%
[27/9/19, 9:42:35 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: he gave so many
[27/9/19, 9:43:05 AM] Yi Kai: Well I took 1 E(the one we did in class), 1A, and 3 higher
[27/9/19, 9:43:10 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: he gave like 4 Am 3 Em 3 higher
[27/9/19, 9:43:13 AM] Yi Kai: Doesn’t mean need do all
[27/9/19, 9:43:22 AM] Yi Kai: Physics I not touching MCQ tbh
[27/9/19, 9:43:33 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: depends how confident i am
[27/9/19, 9:43:46 AM] Yi Kai: Actually maybe I’ll touch 1 since so many say it’s hard, then read higher physics answers
[27/9/19, 9:43:57 AM] Yi Kai: Like actually just need trust yourself
[27/9/19, 9:44:08 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: the d7 makes it a bit hard u know
[27/9/19, 9:44:12 AM] Yi Kai: And at the end of every question, roughly check your answer
[27/9/19, 9:44:27 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ya i always make careless mistakes lmao
[27/9/19, 9:44:28 AM] Yi Kai: I don’t get how you d7 tbh
[27/9/19, 9:44:37 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: uhhh
[27/9/19, 9:44:52 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i feel like im the only one who doesnt retain info
[27/9/19, 9:45:01 AM] Yi Kai: I grind in P6 until practically no careless so yah
[27/9/19, 9:45:04 AM] Yi Kai: ...
[27/9/19, 9:45:06 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: like after i mug for the exam it will just disappear from my brain
[27/9/19, 9:45:14 AM] Yi Kai: That’s me for humans
[27/9/19, 9:45:15 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i mean this year stuff not so bad
[27/9/19, 9:45:27 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: but s3 stuff i forget everyth alr
[27/9/19, 9:45:40 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: humans i always just read 1 day beforehand
[27/9/19, 9:45:50 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: then its in ur short term memory
[27/9/19, 9:45:52 AM] Yi Kai: Some things are not meant for short term memory
[27/9/19, 9:46:10 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i dont know how to retain it tho
[27/9/19, 9:46:25 AM] Yi Kai: It’s like coding, some people put in short term memory, then before contest they’re like
 “I need to Mug”
And I’m like what?!?!
[27/9/19, 9:46:40 AM] Yi Kai: Actually need understand it thoroughly one
[27/9/19, 9:46:48 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i do tho
[27/9/19, 9:47:04 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: lol
[27/9/19, 9:47:12 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: how to compartmentalise short term and long term idek
[27/9/19, 9:47:25 AM] Yi Kai: And if you can roughly summarise the concept in 30 words then you’re good to go
[27/9/19, 9:48:03 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: some stuff cannot summarise tho
[27/9/19, 9:48:05 AM] Yi Kai: But if you’re speaking to Yiqin, keep to 15 words
[27/9/19, 9:48:12 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: what to memorise for the trigo sumproduct formula
[27/9/19, 9:48:13 AM] Yi Kai: Organic cannot lorh
[27/9/19, 9:48:17 AM] Yi Kai: Nothing
[27/9/19, 9:48:20 AM] Yi Kai: They’ll provide
[27/9/19, 9:48:31 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: hmm ok
[27/9/19, 9:48:37 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: everyone says amath is easier than emath
[27/9/19, 9:48:52 AM] Yi Kai: To score, maybe
[27/9/19, 9:49:04 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: yeah
[27/9/19, 9:12:59 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i swear every math question i do theres always 1 careless mistake
[27/9/19, 9:13:10 PM] Yi Kai: Check through
[27/9/19, 9:13:11 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: irs damn annoying
[27/9/19, 9:13:20 PM] Yi Kai: This kind of thing need grind to get rid one
[27/9/19, 9:13:22 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: its aleays some stupid mistake
[27/9/19, 9:13:31 PM] Yi Kai: But good thing is once you get rid, it rarely comes back
[27/9/19, 9:13:38 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: like the habit of checking ah
[27/9/19, 9:13:50 PM] Yi Kai: Habit of checking + carefulness
[27/9/19, 9:14:02 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: mm
[27/9/19, 9:14:04 PM] Yi Kai: Like every line I write I read once after I write one
[27/9/19, 9:14:12 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oh legit
[27/9/19, 9:14:22 PM] Yi Kai: V fast what, just 2 seconds
[27/9/19, 9:14:27 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: aft u finish the whole question do u check everything again
[27/9/19, 9:14:36 PM] Yi Kai: sometimes
[27/9/19, 9:14:52 PM] Yi Kai: Unless it's the kind that's v mafan to check
[27/9/19, 9:15:04 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: hmm ok
[27/9/19, 9:15:07 PM] Yi Kai: But the more marks it's worth, the more you should check when you finish the question
[27/9/19, 9:15:25 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: my stupid shit is like forgetting to reverse the inequality sign after dividing by -4
[27/9/19, 9:15:38 PM] Yi Kai: Oh
[27/9/19, 9:15:56 PM] Yi Kai: Anyway crime and punishment drir is deterrence, rehab, incapacitation and what ah?
[27/9/19, 9:16:02 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: uhh
[27/9/19, 9:16:15 PM] Yi Kai: It's sth about revenge one right
[27/9/19, 9:16:32 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: let me find
[27/9/19, 9:16:48 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: retribution and restitution
[27/9/19, 9:17:00 PM] Yi Kai: restitution more of rehab what
[27/9/19, 9:17:05 PM] Yi Kai: Think its retribution
[27/9/19, 9:17:14 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: theres 5 purposes
[27/9/19, 9:17:33 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: restitution is more of compensating what the criminal has done to the society
[27/9/19, 9:17:38 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: rehab is sth different
[27/9/19, 9:17:37 PM] Yi Kai: ^

Slightly similar but slightly different
[27/9/19, 9:17:43 PM] Yi Kai: Ok fine
[27/9/19, 9:17:52 PM] Yi Kai: But quite rare what
[27/9/19, 9:18:02 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: whats the diff between restitution and retribution
[27/9/19, 9:18:07 PM] Yi Kai: Unless like littering lah
[27/9/19, 9:18:17 PM] Yi Kai: Retribution is revenge, like vengeance
[27/9/19, 9:18:20 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: retribution is it more of punishing the criminal hinself
[27/9/19, 9:18:34 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: for the damage he has caused to the victims
[27/9/19, 9:18:36 PM] Yi Kai: Like you murder some guy then they give you death sentence in return
[27/9/19, 9:18:41 PM] Yi Kai: Yah
[27/9/19, 9:18:57 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: so like if the crime has victims its more of retribution
[27/9/19, 9:19:29 PM] Yi Kai: Kinda
[27/9/19, 9:19:43 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: then if its sth like littering or vandalism its more of restitution
[27/9/19, 9:20:03 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i would say this also has retribution cus it usually is accompanied with a fine or jail
[27/9/19, 9:20:11 PM] Yi Kai: Reminds me when my p6 pe teacher's punishment would be:

Go to the field and fetch me 5 pieces of litter
[27/9/19, 9:20:40 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: corrective work order or stuff like forking out the money they robbed is restitution
[27/9/19, 9:20:40 PM] Yi Kai: Each part got diff purpose lah
[27/9/19, 9:20:48 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: LOL
[27/9/19, 9:20:59 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ur field so dirty ah
[27/9/19, 9:21:32 PM] Yi Kai: I don't know, never kena before
[27/9/19, 9:40:14 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: so well behaved?!
[27/9/19, 9:40:28 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i realised i didnt do any of the revision papers maumu gave last year for eoy
[27/9/19, 9:40:35 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: probably thats why i got i3
[27/9/19, 9:40:37 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: 73
[27/9/19, 9:42:49 PM] Yi Kai: Same
[27/9/19, 9:43:31 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: is it easier to find P(x) by long div or by observation
[27/9/19, 9:44:04 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: some cubic equation = P(x)•(2x-1) for example
[27/9/19, 9:45:07 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: then u can find coefficient of x2 and constant in P(x) then sub in a random x value to find coefficient of x
[27/9/19, 9:45:28 PM] Yi Kai: Long division if you ask me
[27/9/19, 9:45:43 PM] Yi Kai: 'Cause observation need explain here there v mafan
[27/9/19, 9:46:18 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: is there any situation where u must use one method and cant use the other
[27/9/19, 9:46:28 PM] Yi Kai: Doubt so
[27/9/19, 9:46:31 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: idts right
[27/9/19, 9:46:36 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: okel
‎[28/9/19, 12:59:14 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ‎image omitted
[28/9/19, 1:01:59 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oh nvm u can just ignore the left side of the inequality cus mod 2x-3 is always greater than or equal to 0
[28/9/19, 1:02:28 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: then for the first part right can u just jump straight to -5 < 2x-3 < 5
[28/9/19, 9:48:04 PM] Yi Kai: SS is so cancer...
[28/9/19, 10:31:15 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i havent started on ses
[28/9/19, 10:31:16 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oops
[28/9/19, 10:31:23 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ss*
[28/9/19, 10:31:37 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ^^
[29/9/19, 12:34:56 AM] Yi Kai: Yah
[29/9/19, 10:27:43 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: csc how mug ah
[29/9/19, 10:27:51 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: just read the yidaiyilu stuff he gave right
[29/9/19, 10:28:01 AM] Yi Kai: Yah
[29/9/19, 10:28:06 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i mean if u want u can also try find points for impacts and suggestions
[29/9/19, 10:28:16 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: but then u only need 1 para for each qn
[29/9/19, 10:28:21 AM] Yi Kai: He gave the points for that already what
[29/9/19, 10:28:27 AM] Yi Kai: Wait legit meh?
[29/9/19, 10:28:28 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: wdym
[29/9/19, 10:28:34 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: huh
[29/9/19, 10:28:35 AM] Yi Kai: It’s in SLS
[29/9/19, 10:28:47 AM] Yi Kai: I remember there’s 3 questions
[29/9/19, 10:28:55 AM] Yi Kai: Aiyah still more than one week lah
[29/9/19, 10:29:00 AM] Yi Kai: Reading it takes one day
[29/9/19, 10:29:10 AM] Yi Kai: With help of Google translate
[29/9/19, 10:29:11 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: qn1 is most probably definition so 1 para

qn 2 and 3 is 2 or 3 paras of impacts and suggestions from sources, and then 1 para of ur own
[29/9/19, 10:29:18 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: wdym 1 day
[29/9/19, 10:29:31 AM] Yi Kai: Then what, 1 hour?
[29/9/19, 10:29:47 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: a few hours i guess
[29/9/19, 10:30:00 AM] Yi Kai: Oh ok I thought you mean q2/3 is only 1 para
[29/9/19, 10:30:09 AM] Yi Kai: Actually need evaluation one right?
[29/9/19, 10:30:19 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: wait need ah
[29/9/19, 10:30:23 AM] Yi Kai: Cause he say if you want A1 then need write
[29/9/19, 10:30:27 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: wtf
[29/9/19, 10:30:28 AM] Yi Kai: So basically need
[29/9/19, 10:30:39 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: how evaluate
[29/9/19, 10:31:08 AM] Yi Kai: Same as last year whât
[29/9/19, 10:31:08 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: is it u smoke some shit out about the long term vs short term or like the extent of impact
[29/9/19, 10:31:19 AM] Yi Kai: That sort of thing lorh
[29/9/19, 10:31:20 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: forgot what yelp said alr
[29/9/19, 10:31:23 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oh ok

[30/9/19, 5:02:56 PM] Yi Kai: Wt
[30/9/19, 5:03:06 PM] Yi Kai: Why I kena 74
[30/9/19, 5:03:09 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: thats damn sad
[30/9/19, 5:03:30 PM] Yi Kai: Anyway A2 not counter right?
[30/9/19, 5:03:36 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ya
[30/9/19, 5:03:43 PM] Yi Kai: Ok
[30/9/19, 5:04:19 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: lol huang junwei also got 74
[30/9/19, 5:04:45 PM] Yi Kai: Oh legit?
[30/9/19, 5:04:48 PM] Yi Kai: Bruh...
[30/9/19, 5:05:05 PM] Yi Kai: I see Guan lin 66 and I feel better
[30/9/19, 5:05:14 PM] Yi Kai: So I can tell myself it’s just tanck being strict
[30/9/19, 5:05:55 PM] Yi Kai: Mainly cause I exceeded time limit by like 1 minute cause I didn’t take into account time I need to draw on board
[30/9/19, 5:06:27 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: his grpmate got 69 feels even worse
[30/9/19, 5:06:42 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: yiqin said he could draw on the board first tho
[30/9/19, 5:07:03 PM] Yi Kai: It’s true
[30/9/19, 5:07:16 PM] Yi Kai: But I don’t have enough space to draw finish all my figures
[30/9/19, 5:07:47 PM] Yi Kai: DSO cause tanck drew 1 big figure in the middle before I walked in for purpose of q and a
[30/9/19, 5:16:50 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oh oops
[1/10/19, 2:17:28 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: wait do uk how calculate
[1/10/19, 2:17:31 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: the ses and csc marks
[1/10/19, 2:20:16 PM] Yi Kai: SES is 0.7AU
[1/10/19, 2:20:37 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: apart from the class test we did we also had a graded essay thing
[1/10/19, 2:20:37 PM] Yi Kai: Within SES, 70% is what he posted, the other 30% probably split equally on term 2 and 3
[1/10/19, 2:20:42 PM] Yi Kai: Yah
[1/10/19, 2:20:48 PM] Yi Kai: Can’t remember what I got though
[1/10/19, 2:20:53 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: same tbh
[1/10/19, 2:21:04 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: why is ur marks so much higher than me and dongjuns
[1/10/19, 2:21:05 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: fml
[1/10/19, 2:21:09 PM] Yi Kai: ISP probably recorded
[1/10/19, 2:21:15 PM] Yi Kai: You think I know ah?
[1/10/19, 2:21:21 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: it records together with csc
[1/10/19, 2:21:27 PM] Yi Kai: Presentation whole group same mark or what?
[1/10/19, 2:21:34 PM] Yi Kai: Oh yah...
[1/10/19, 2:21:35 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i got 78 for t2
[1/10/19, 2:21:41 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i also dk
[1/10/19, 2:21:47 PM] Yi Kai: SES?
[1/10/19, 2:21:56 PM] Yi Kai: Then dao lorh
[1/10/19, 2:22:03 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ses + csc
[1/10/19, 2:22:04 PM] Yi Kai: EOY CSC also 70% what
[1/10/19, 2:22:08 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: and then i got 74 for t3
[1/10/19, 2:22:13 PM] Yi Kai: Lmao
[1/10/19, 2:22:13 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ya
[1/10/19, 2:22:38 PM] Yi Kai: So just take 30% on t2-3 grade, 70% on CSC EOY and SES
[1/10/19, 2:22:50 PM] Yi Kai: #math
[1/10/19, 2:23:01 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oh ya true
[1/10/19, 2:23:02 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: LOL
[1/10/19, 2:23:14 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: so 15 each ah
[1/10/19, 2:23:26 PM] Yi Kai: Yah
[1/10/19, 2:23:41 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: wait but ses got 2 tests csc only got 1
[1/10/19, 2:23:47 PM] Yi Kai: But the EOY part need to take into account that both not equally weighted
[1/10/19, 2:23:54 PM] Yi Kai: CSC term 3 was presentation
[1/10/19, 2:24:00 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ya
[1/10/19, 2:24:00 PM] Yi Kai: Getting carried by Shuyi
[1/10/19, 2:24:06 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: totally forgot about that
[1/10/19, 2:28:59 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: omg i neeg 40/50 for csc to get overall a1
[1/10/19, 2:29:18 PM] Yi Kai: Wot
[1/10/19, 2:29:22 PM] Yi Kai: Wow
[1/10/19, 2:29:38 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: still achievable actually
[1/10/19, 2:29:41 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: but ok can
[1/10/19, 2:29:40 PM] Yi Kai: Then definitely need the paragraph where you analyse the points
[1/10/19, 2:29:43 PM] Yi Kai: True
[1/10/19, 2:29:46 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: huh
[1/10/19, 2:29:55 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: analyse which one more important?
[1/10/19, 2:30:59 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: 10m
15m
25m
[1/10/19, 2:31:06 PM] Yi Kai: Yah
[1/10/19, 2:31:19 PM] Yi Kai: As in in the response
[1/10/19, 2:31:26 PM] Yi Kai: 最严峻的挑战
[1/10/19, 2:31:32 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: wait is it for both the 15 and 25m one
[1/10/19, 2:31:37 PM] Yi Kai: Think so
[1/10/19, 2:31:41 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: f
[1/10/19, 2:31:54 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: 10m - 1 para
15m - 4 para
25m - 5 para
[1/10/19, 2:32:00 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: or is it 1 3 4
[1/10/19, 2:32:03 PM] Yi Kai: I don’t know
[1/10/19, 2:32:11 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i forgot what he said
[1/10/19, 2:32:14 PM] Yi Kai: Wangdk essentially just say answer the way they ask
[1/10/19, 2:32:26 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: 2 or 3 from passage then 1 point from urself and then evaluate
[1/10/19, 2:32:26 PM] Yi Kai: And make sure you have 1 point on your own
[1/10/19, 2:32:46 PM] Yi Kai: And unless you want to get damn high A1 don’t need to analyse

In other words, you should
[1/10/19, 2:32:54 PM] Yi Kai: Guess so
[1/10/19, 2:32:58 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: yes
[1/10/19, 2:32:59 PM] Yi Kai: He didn’t say how many points
[1/10/19, 2:33:22 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: what if the points i mug on his sls and google classroom come up as the sources
[1/10/19, 2:33:30 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: then it wouldnt be considered as my point anymore
[1/10/19, 2:34:02 PM] Yi Kai: Likely, I heard that’s what happened
[1/10/19, 2:34:13 PM] Yi Kai: If you Mug 5 points they can’t all come out right?
[1/10/19, 2:34:19 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: happened where
[1/10/19, 2:34:28 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: but mugging 5 points is cancer
[1/10/19, 2:34:36 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: but ok i will do it for the a1
[1/10/19, 2:34:39 PM] Yi Kai: Like my NOI senior was like “CSC is just stupid, the notes are the sources”
[1/10/19, 2:34:44 PM] Yi Kai: Mug SS first
[1/10/19, 2:34:48 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: notes?
[1/10/19, 2:34:59 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i only mugged 8 to 11
[1/10/19, 2:35:06 PM] Yi Kai: 7 is important
[1/10/19, 2:35:19 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: its damn long ill probably mug tmr
[1/10/19, 2:35:22 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: today do el
[1/10/19, 2:50:14 PM] Yi Kai: Just spam read right?
[1/10/19, 2:50:33 PM] Yi Kai: Guess I can’t keep my laptop to stop myself from playing survivio then
[1/10/19, 2:50:55 PM] Yi Kai: I’ve gotten a few more chicken dinners
[1/10/19, 2:56:10 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: Ya but take note of words that u can use to make ur. essay look chimmer
[1/10/19, 2:56:24 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: some are easy to use
[1/10/19, 2:56:44 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: but then i hope im studying for the correct topic tho
[1/10/19, 2:57:05 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ltr science tech and edu don't come out
[1/10/19, 3:01:15 PM] Yi Kai: Gg leh like that
[1/10/19, 3:01:24 PM] Yi Kai: I heavily rely on s&t
[1/10/19, 3:12:28 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: but then what if they give a v hard to ans question for sci
[1/10/19, 3:39:01 PM] Yi Kai: True
[3/10/19, 1:30:55 PM] Yi Kai: What do you intend to study for physics ah?
[3/10/19, 1:31:07 PM] Yi Kai: Other than down do practice
[3/10/19, 1:31:41 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i also dk how to study physics tbh
[3/10/19, 1:31:53 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: probably do every practice there is
[3/10/19, 1:32:36 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: did she post the answers for the t2 and t3 revision exercises
[3/10/19, 1:35:20 PM] Yi Kai: Probably
[3/10/19, 1:35:34 PM] Yi Kai: Ask around will find it one
[3/10/19, 1:35:55 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ol
[3/10/19, 1:35:56 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ok
[3/10/19, 1:36:02 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: probably doing physics tmr aft emath
[3/10/19, 1:36:12 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: idk if im overpreparing for emath
[3/10/19, 1:39:30 PM] Yi Kai: Yes you are
[3/10/19, 1:39:35 PM] Yi Kai: Do chem first lah
[3/10/19, 1:39:46 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i feel more confident in chem tho
[3/10/19, 1:39:49 PM] Yi Kai: Can bring your electrolysis notes tomorrow, I can’t find mine
[3/10/19, 1:39:58 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: photocopy?
[3/10/19, 1:40:16 PM] Yi Kai: I’ll just flip through
[3/10/19, 1:40:21 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: siao
[3/10/19, 1:40:28 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ok
[3/10/19, 1:40:33 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: just electrolysis ah
[3/10/19, 1:40:45 PM] Yi Kai: And I’ll also take picture of the something series lah
[3/10/19, 1:40:48 PM] Yi Kai: Should be
[3/10/19, 1:40:56 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: anything
[3/10/19, 1:41:01 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: hmmmm

[3/10/19, 1:41:23 PM] Yi Kai: Can’t really remember the list of topics anyway
[3/10/19, 1:41:35 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: same
[3/10/19, 4:09:09 PM] Yi Kai: Was there salt preparation notes?
[3/10/19, 4:09:51 PM] Yi Kai: Nvm found it
‎[3/10/19, 4:19:11 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ‎image omitted
[3/10/19, 4:19:39 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ik my range is wrong cus p cant be negative in the first place but why isnt the range 0 <= p < 4
[3/10/19, 4:20:13 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i mean 2 instead of 4
[3/10/19, 4:51:50 PM] Yi Kai: Quite sure need
[3/10/19, 5:01:14 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: the ans dh
[3/10/19, 5:01:18 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ill probably write
[3/10/19, 5:01:28 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i got 9 marks of careless from that paper
[3/10/19, 5:46:47 PM] Yi Kai: Cause it’s emath
[3/10/19, 5:48:40 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: it matters meh
[3/10/19, 7:04:15 PM] Yi Kai: Well maumu once mentioned that the +- isn't specific enough but then the rest of the dept still wants to accept it
[3/10/19, 7:04:22 PM] Yi Kai: So it's kinda the same thing
[3/10/19, 7:05:03 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oh ok
[3/10/19, 7:06:44 PM] Yi Kai: How to name polymers ah?
[3/10/19, 7:06:56 PM] Yi Kai: I know that addition polymerisation is poly(<name of monomer>)
[3/10/19, 7:07:01 PM] Yi Kai: But what about condensation?
[3/10/19, 7:07:03 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: we onlt need to know those few for condensation what
[3/10/19, 7:07:14 PM] Yi Kai: Like the general names?
[3/10/19, 7:07:22 PM] Yi Kai: Like nylon and terylene and stuff ah
[3/10/19, 7:07:26 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ya
[3/10/19, 7:07:34 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: we didnt learn how to name it chemically right
[3/10/19, 7:09:37 PM] Yi Kai: Probably
[4/10/19, 11:39:32 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: wait i forgot to lend u my electrolysis notes
[4/10/19, 11:39:41 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: do u want me to take pics
[4/10/19, 12:15:31 PM] Yi Kai: Nvm dao
[4/10/19, 12:15:42 PM] Yi Kai: Zhiheng sent me the electro whatever series
[4/10/19, 2:15:14 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: Oh ok
[4/10/19, 3:53:55 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: why is paper 1 and paper 2 for chem separated
[4/10/19, 3:54:02 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: pretty sure most people finish paper 1 way ahead of time
[4/10/19, 4:08:04 PM] Yi Kai: Dao lah
[4/10/19, 4:08:07 PM] Yi Kai: Toilet break
[4/10/19, 4:46:14 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: LOL
[4/10/19, 4:46:19 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: whole class go toilet break
[4/10/19, 5:23:19 PM] Yi Kai: Legit what
[4/10/19, 5:23:24 PM] Yi Kai: 15 minutes break only
[4/10/19, 5:32:48 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oh true
[4/10/19, 5:33:04 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: higher chem just mug everyth right
[4/10/19, 5:38:54 PM] Yi Kai: Yah
[4/10/19, 6:34:06 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: electrolysis of aqueous solution for smtp do we consider water as a particle/species or do we consider h+ and oh-
[4/10/19, 6:40:00 PM] Yi Kai: Just do water
[4/10/19, 6:40:17 PM] Yi Kai: Later they say you smtp and mark you wrong for hydrogen and hydroxide ion
[4/10/19, 6:40:35 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: wait why does smtp consider the particle as h2o
[4/10/19, 6:50:38 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oh its cus water is electrolysed not the individual ions
[4/10/19, 6:50:39 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: makes sensr
[4/10/19, 9:56:38 PM] Yi Kai: Do you still intend to take bio lol
[4/10/19, 9:57:09 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: lol why
[4/10/19, 9:57:14 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i havent made my decision
[4/10/19, 9:57:44 PM] Yi Kai: I was thinking of coding problem and suddenly realised that I forgot about advertising computing
[4/10/19, 9:57:53 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: siao
[4/10/19, 9:57:59 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: is anyone from our class gonna take
[4/10/19, 9:58:15 PM] Yi Kai: Cause xingyu cant chem and we were trying to persuade him to start mugging, if not can only arts stream
[4/10/19, 9:58:20 PM] Yi Kai: Yiqin lmao
[4/10/19, 9:58:31 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: wait
[4/10/19, 9:58:37 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oh ya sci stream requires chem
[4/10/19, 9:58:40 PM] Yi Kai: He gets F9 chem
[4/10/19, 9:58:53 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: why tho
[4/10/19, 9:59:01 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: im glad we have sow
[4/10/19, 9:59:06 PM] Yi Kai: Same
[4/10/19, 9:59:18 PM] Yi Kai: He doesn’t even listen in class how help him
[4/10/19, 9:59:25 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: no wonder
[4/10/19, 9:59:28 PM] Yi Kai: He’s like I have notes but all blank
[4/10/19, 9:59:37 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: lol
[4/10/19, 9:59:49 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: he wants arts stream meh
[4/10/19, 10:00:05 PM] Yi Kai: Don’t think so
[4/10/19, 10:00:36 PM] Yi Kai: After reading my POP gift I understand that it’s normal I find him very stupid based on both our personality profiles
[4/10/19, 10:00:52 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: him?
[4/10/19, 10:00:57 PM] Yi Kai: Xingyu
[4/10/19, 10:01:35 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: amazing 心得
[4/10/19, 10:01:42 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: tell me more
[4/10/19, 10:01:56 PM] Yi Kai: It’s based on disc personality profiling
[4/10/19, 10:02:02 PM] Yi Kai: But they use colours
[4/10/19, 10:02:27 PM] Yi Kai: I’m c and he’s i, and therefore it’s normal that I’ll view him that way
[4/10/19, 10:04:05 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: whats me
[4/10/19, 10:04:10 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: how do u determine it
[4/10/19, 10:04:30 PM] Yi Kai: There’s online test
[4/10/19, 10:04:39 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: let me try
[4/10/19, 10:04:48 PM] Yi Kai: But I essentially derive it by reading the description of all 4 and seeing which I fit most
[4/10/19, 10:04:55 PM] Yi Kai: Just go search confirm have one
[4/10/19, 10:05:00 PM] Yi Kai: ^
[4/10/19, 10:05:17 PM] Yi Kai: I’d think your s
[4/10/19, 10:05:25 PM] Yi Kai: You’re s*
[4/10/19, 10:05:49 PM] Yi Kai: In the book disc becomes red yellow green blue
[4/10/19, 10:26:51 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ooo
[4/10/19, 10:26:57 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: the descriptions online are very vagur
[4/10/19, 10:27:24 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: did u do the 16 personalities test before
[4/10/19, 10:32:35 PM] Yi Kai: Yes
[4/10/19, 10:32:41 PM] Yi Kai: They gave us at boarding
[4/10/19, 10:32:50 PM] Yi Kai: The one with 4 scales right?
[4/10/19, 10:32:56 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: yep
[4/10/19, 10:33:11 PM] Yi Kai: Yah
[4/10/19, 10:33:16 PM] Yi Kai: Why
[4/10/19, 10:33:21 PM] Yi Kai: You doing that now ah?
[4/10/19, 10:33:28 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: lol ya
[4/10/19, 10:33:29 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: what r u
[4/10/19, 10:33:33 PM] Yi Kai: Intj
[4/10/19, 10:33:38 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i did it a while back but i forgot mine alr
[4/10/19, 10:33:46 PM] Yi Kai: int j;
[4/10/19, 10:37:25 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: wtf i got isfp a
[4/10/19, 10:37:52 PM] Yi Kai: Whys there 5 letters
[4/10/19, 10:38:01 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: its 5 letters
[4/10/19, 10:38:01 PM] Yi Kai: And I already forgot what each letter means
[4/10/19, 10:38:05 PM] Yi Kai: Huh
[4/10/19, 10:38:09 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i never knew what it meant
[4/10/19, 10:38:18 PM] Yi Kai: 2^4=16

2^5=32
[4/10/19, 10:38:42 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: the a thing is separate tho
[4/10/19, 10:38:54 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: its assertive or turbulent
[4/10/19, 10:39:09 PM] Yi Kai: Oh
[4/10/19, 10:39:13 PM] Yi Kai: That’s why I don’t have
‎[4/10/19, 10:39:18 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ‎image omitted
[4/10/19, 10:39:44 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: why do i feel like its not accurate
[4/10/19, 10:42:58 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oh i rmb now last time i did it i got istj and isfj
[5/10/19, 11:17:06 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: wait why is heating required for less reactive metals to combust
[5/10/19, 11:17:19 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: combustion of zinc requires very strong heating
[5/10/19, 11:28:33 AM] Yi Kai: Cause they’re less reactive they’ll need more heat to react with oxygen
[5/10/19, 11:28:49 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: whats the heat for
[5/10/19, 11:36:45 AM] Yi Kai: Dk
[5/10/19, 11:36:57 AM] Yi Kai: Maybe to speed up rate of reaction
[5/10/19, 11:47:51 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oo ok
[5/10/19, 1:23:20 PM] Yi Kai: Totally forgot about ideal gas assumptions lol
[5/10/19, 1:39:38 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: idek the assumptions anymore
[5/10/19, 1:39:39 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: need mug

[5/10/19, 2:32:23 PM] Yi Kai: Salt preparation
[5/10/19, 2:35:34 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oxide is slow reaction w acid i think
[5/10/19, 2:35:43 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: just write warm for everything
[5/10/19, 2:37:18 PM] Yi Kai: why
[5/10/19, 2:37:34 PM] Yi Kai: You see, if we keep asking why, we'll eventually realise how ignorant we are
[5/10/19, 2:37:42 PM] Yi Kai: But still, srsly why
[5/10/19, 2:40:20 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i dun know lol
[5/10/19, 2:40:24 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: why
[5/10/19, 2:43:06 PM] Yi Kai: The compre passage
[5/10/19, 2:43:58 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: big brain
[5/10/19, 2:45:16 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i realise sowpeh didnt separate higher paper syllabus from ip syllabus this year
[5/10/19, 2:45:28 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i thot there was nth abt higher paper
[5/10/19, 2:53:35 PM] Yi Kai: Just that it's like within
[5/10/19, 2:53:50 PM] Yi Kai: Actually which one is higher paper ah, only the stages of chlorination of alkanes ah?
[5/10/19, 3:01:19 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: idk i think some stuff i never see in the ip paper
[5/10/19, 3:01:34 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: like the enthalpy change = q/n thing
[5/10/19, 3:24:05 PM] Yi Kai: Oh
[5/10/19, 3:24:27 PM] Yi Kai: n is the number of moles of gas per number of moles in the equation right
[5/10/19, 3:24:36 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: huh
[5/10/19, 3:24:40 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: gas?
[5/10/19, 3:24:47 PM] Yi Kai: Like if theres 5 mols of co2, and theres 2 CO2 in the equation
[5/10/19, 3:24:51 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: no. of mol of limiting reagent
[5/10/19, 3:24:56 PM] Yi Kai: Or whatever substance
[5/10/19, 3:25:09 PM] Yi Kai: Then shouldn't it be q/2.5 instead of q/5
‎[5/10/19, 3:25:26 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ‎image omitted
[5/10/19, 3:25:44 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: u mean 2
[5/10/19, 3:26:00 PM] Yi Kai: 5 mols in the experiment
[5/10/19, 3:26:12 PM] Yi Kai: Yah ofc what...
[5/10/19, 3:26:25 PM] Yi Kai: 'Cause not enough oxygen then incomplete combustion occurs
[5/10/19, 3:26:41 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: as in the carbon monoxide and soot is separate equation
[5/10/19, 3:28:14 PM] Yi Kai: Then I don't know
[5/10/19, 3:28:21 PM] Yi Kai: Maybe depends on how much oxygen
[5/10/19, 5:50:20 PM] Yi Kai: NANI!!! - https://www.chess.com/live/game/4091493670
[5/10/19, 5:53:23 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: lmao
[5/10/19, 5:53:27 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: he gave u so many pieces
[5/10/19, 5:55:31 PM] Yi Kai: You mean I gave him
[5/10/19, 5:57:01 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: u got meh
[5/10/19, 5:57:45 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: anyways whats the units for angle of deflection if its calculated with charge/mass
[5/10/19, 5:58:06 PM] Yi Kai: I suggest you look at the colour of the pieces
[5/10/19, 5:58:18 PM] Yi Kai: Or rather, the side I was playing
[5/10/19, 5:58:18 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oops i thought u were the one at the bottom
[5/10/19, 5:58:37 PM] Yi Kai: Lol
[5/10/19, 5:58:54 PM] Yi Kai: And then he resigned, just when i was thinking about resigning
[5/10/19, 6:02:27 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: why tho
[5/10/19, 6:02:48 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: bm
[5/10/19, 6:03:04 PM] Yi Kai: I think he had to go
[5/10/19, 6:03:54 PM] Yi Kai: Like reminds of people on survivio who can clearly win their opponent and get #1.

Then the opponent gives a smiley face, and they just kill themselves with grenade and get second
[5/10/19, 6:11:38 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: he was a few moves from winning tho
[5/10/19, 6:11:53 PM] Yi Kai: Like 2 moves or less I think
[5/10/19, 6:23:14 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ya
[5/10/19, 6:23:21 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: just move the queen
[5/10/19, 6:24:24 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: wait
[5/10/19, 6:24:29 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: rook h7 then queen f7
[5/10/19, 6:24:33 PM] Yi Kai: Yah
[5/10/19, 6:25:06 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: or rook d8 also can
[5/10/19, 6:25:09 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: then eat bishop
[5/10/19, 6:25:37 PM] Yi Kai: That one not as fast what
[5/10/19, 6:25:50 PM] Yi Kai: Cause if he eat bishop I can take back with king
[5/10/19, 6:30:08 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: u cant what the other rook is protecting it
[5/10/19, 6:30:21 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: rook d1 to d8 i mean
[5/10/19, 6:30:57 PM] Yi Kai: Oh
[5/10/19, 6:31:07 PM] Yi Kai: Actually it’s 3 moves from mate
[5/10/19, 6:31:16 PM] Yi Kai: But this is 2
[5/10/19, 6:31:49 PM] Yi Kai: Cause after rook h7 I can move bishop to g7
[5/10/19, 6:31:48 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: isnt it 2
[5/10/19, 6:32:06 PM] Yi Kai: e7*
[5/10/19, 6:32:09 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oh true
[5/10/19, 10:47:42 PM] Yi Kai: How does higher paper grading work liao ah?
[5/10/19, 10:47:50 PM] Yi Kai: 75% high d then what
[5/10/19, 10:48:01 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: 26 d
[5/10/19, 10:48:03 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: 22 merit
[5/10/19, 10:48:06 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: 18 pass
[5/10/19, 10:48:08 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: out of 40 i mean
[5/10/19, 10:48:09 PM] Yi Kai: Ok
[5/10/19, 10:48:14 PM] Yi Kai: Yah ik what you mean
[5/10/19, 10:48:27 PM] Yi Kai: Then why Ng the other day say only need 40% pass lmao
[5/10/19, 10:48:51 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: wait what
[5/10/19, 10:48:57 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: either her maths fail or they changed it
[5/10/19, 10:49:00 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: probably the former
[5/10/19, 10:50:24 PM] Yi Kai: Lol
[5/10/19, 10:50:59 PM] Yi Kai: Just like her english
[5/10/19, 10:51:37 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: do u want a mairnet
[5/10/19, 11:33:39 PM] Yi Kai: ?
[5/10/19, 11:33:42 PM] Yi Kai: What’s that
[5/10/19, 11:34:26 PM] Yi Kai: Oh ok nvm
[5/10/19, 11:34:51 PM] Yi Kai: I went to Google that word and found it to be an Italian internet service provider
[5/10/19, 11:34:56 PM] Yi Kai: So you mean magnet
[6/10/19, 6:40:06 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: yes
[6/10/19, 8:33:16 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: dispersion forces refer to id-id right
[6/10/19, 8:33:28 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: then pdpd we must write as pdpd?
[6/10/19, 8:33:31 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: for higher paper btw
[6/10/19, 8:33:40 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: im gonna writr van der Waals for ip
[6/10/19, 9:00:33 AM] Yi Kai: Yes
[6/10/19, 9:00:42 AM] Yi Kai: Need write the whole thing
[6/10/19, 9:01:18 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oh ok
[6/10/19, 9:10:07 AM] Yi Kai: Chem and physics need shade OAS?
[6/10/19, 9:11:05 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: wait i dun rmb what we did lasr year
[6/10/19, 9:11:07 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oops
[6/10/19, 9:11:16 AM] Yi Kai: ...
[6/10/19, 9:11:29 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i think there was tho
[6/10/19, 10:53:32 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: 复习Google classroom, SLS里面的相关资料
[6/10/19, 10:53:43 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: is this a clear enough indication that its yidaiyilu
[6/10/19, 10:53:47 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: lol
[6/10/19, 10:59:21 AM] Yi Kai: Lol
[6/10/19, 11:06:30 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: is 69.8 rounded to a2
[6/10/19, 11:06:41 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: bruh for a2 i need 27/50 for csc
[6/10/19, 11:06:44 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: a1 is 40/50
[6/10/19, 11:06:51 AM] Yi Kai: Maybe
[6/10/19, 11:06:53 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: thats such a big difference
[6/10/19, 11:06:56 AM] Yi Kai: Lmao
[6/10/19, 11:07:08 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: think u can fail and get a1
[6/10/19, 11:07:22 AM] Yi Kai: Legit meh?
[6/10/19, 11:07:28 AM] Yi Kai: I go calculate
[6/10/19, 11:07:37 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: what u get for the 30% one
[6/10/19, 11:07:41 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: like the t2 and t3
[6/10/19, 11:08:05 AM] Yi Kai: Cause for my EOY part to be A1, SES 80%, and I will need CSC to be about 60%
[6/10/19, 11:08:09 AM] Yi Kai: Forgot lah
[6/10/19, 11:08:13 AM] Yi Kai: About 78%
[6/10/19, 11:08:17 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ses is 70%
[6/10/19, 11:08:21 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ok let me clauclate
[6/10/19, 11:10:04 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: u need 28 to get 75.06
[6/10/19, 11:10:06 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: wtf
[6/10/19, 11:11:08 AM] Yi Kai: Lmao wot
[6/10/19, 11:11:32 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: dont need study alr
[6/10/19, 11:11:47 AM] Yi Kai: Anyway I just went to check, my t3 is 84.4, my t2 is 78.8, so the average is 81.5 around there
[6/10/19, 11:12:38 AM] Yi Kai: I'll have nothing to do, so I'll study
[6/10/19, 11:12:48 AM] Yi Kai: Anyway I gtg for now
[6/10/19, 11:12:49 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: now u need 25 to get 74.85
[6/10/19, 11:12:55 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: wtf
[6/10/19, 11:12:58 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ok bb
[6/10/19, 11:14:29 AM] Yi Kai: What?
[6/10/19, 11:15:00 AM] Yi Kai: I’m not gonna do a-math, and I won’t have 2 days for physics, so dao CSC for what? Chinese ah
[6/10/19, 11:54:15 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: not having to revise math saves so much time
[6/10/19, 12:16:25 PM] Yi Kai: You tell me, what to revise for math
[6/10/19, 12:16:45 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: sorry im not that smart ok
[6/10/19, 12:16:57 PM] Yi Kai: I’m not saying you shouldn’t study
[6/10/19, 12:17:03 PM] Yi Kai: I’m just asking what you study
[6/10/19, 12:17:10 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i do practice questions

[6/10/19, 2:41:23 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: do uk how the assumptions of an ideal gas worm
[6/10/19, 2:41:30 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: work
[6/10/19, 2:42:26 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: the volume of gas is negligible compared to the volume of the container and the negligible intermolecular forces
[6/10/19, 3:22:37 PM] Yi Kai: Yah
[6/10/19, 3:22:39 PM] Yi Kai: What about it
[6/10/19, 3:22:58 PM] Yi Kai: Also, should I do higher chem set c or normal chem set d paper 2
[6/10/19, 3:23:08 PM] Yi Kai: I did higher set A yesterday and just did higher set b
[6/10/19, 3:25:42 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: like whats the reason behind those assumptions
[6/10/19, 3:25:45 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: higher chem
[6/10/19, 3:26:00 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: set d looks familiar
[6/10/19, 3:26:15 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: at least the section B first question does
[6/10/19, 3:29:56 PM] Yi Kai: So that you can assume they're just random particles flying everywhere
[6/10/19, 3:30:26 PM] Yi Kai: Lol why

Set D mcq is the first paper where I get full marks lol
[6/10/19, 3:30:42 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: lol same
[6/10/19, 3:31:14 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: normal chem probably u can answer alr so do higher chem
[6/10/19, 3:34:58 PM] Yi Kai: True
‎[6/10/19, 5:50:43 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ‎image omitted
[6/10/19, 5:50:52 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: apart from the missing charge on na
[6/10/19, 6:57:26 PM] Yi Kai: I don’t know I drew this too
[6/10/19, 6:57:34 PM] Yi Kai: How about you pm sow
[6/10/19, 7:31:05 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: n2 + 3 h2 -> 2 nh3
[6/10/19, 7:31:18 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: as in reversible sign
[6/10/19, 7:31:52 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: when u add more h2 into the mixture, will the concebtration of h2 go back to the original concentration
[6/10/19, 7:32:07 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: or will it be a little higher than the original
[6/10/19, 7:54:38 PM] Yi Kai: Probably a bit higher than original
[6/10/19, 7:59:02 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oh ok
[6/10/19, 9:08:53 PM] Yi Kai: Wah lucky I do higher C
[6/10/19, 9:09:09 PM] Yi Kai: If not I completely forgot the need to study the reaction when the ppt dissolve in excess reagent
[6/10/19, 9:09:21 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: qa ah
[6/10/19, 9:09:37 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: aqueous nh3 is copper and zinc will form complex ion
[6/10/19, 9:09:45 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: naoh is ZAP
[6/10/19, 9:10:26 PM] Yi Kai: Kind of
[6/10/19, 9:10:34 PM] Yi Kai: Yah so what is the complex ion?
[6/10/19, 9:10:47 PM] Yi Kai: That's kinda what they asked
[6/10/19, 9:10:55 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: Cu(NH3)2+ + 2 OH-
[6/10/19, 9:11:03 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: wait the nh3 supposed to be 4
[6/10/19, 9:11:13 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: Cu(NH3)4 2+ + 2 OH-
[6/10/19, 9:11:22 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: Zn(NH3)4 2+ + 2 OH-
[6/10/19, 9:11:34 PM] Yi Kai: Yes
[6/10/19, 9:11:41 PM] Yi Kai: And yes
[6/10/19, 9:11:58 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: then naoh is just zap become oxidation state of 4?
[6/10/19, 9:12:08 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: then add more oh- ions
[6/10/19, 9:12:30 PM] Yi Kai: Zn (OH)4  2-(whole thing)
[6/10/19, 9:12:36 PM] Yi Kai: The rest I don't have any notes
[6/10/19, 9:12:42 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ya
[6/10/19, 9:12:47 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: aluminium also same thing
[6/10/19, 9:12:52 PM] Yi Kai: Al (OH4)  -
[6/10/19, 9:12:57 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ya
[6/10/19, 9:13:02 PM] Yi Kai: Yah 'cause you were on the doc just now
[6/10/19, 9:13:06 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: lead is too
[6/10/19, 9:13:08 PM] Yi Kai: What about lead though
[6/10/19, 9:13:12 PM] Yi Kai: Same as zinc ah?
[6/10/19, 9:13:13 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: lol just reading answers
[6/10/19, 9:13:18 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: yes
[6/10/19, 9:21:54 PM] Yi Kai: For macromolecule if put bracket always need put n right?
[6/10/19, 9:22:09 PM] Yi Kai: So only need that when they ask for the structure of the macromolecule right
[6/10/19, 9:22:28 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: yeah
[6/10/19, 9:22:36 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ya
[6/10/19, 9:22:48 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: they can only ask repeat unit or structure or monomer anyways
[6/10/19, 9:22:55 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: structure is the only one that needs
[6/10/19, 9:23:05 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: studying for csc is so sian
[6/10/19, 9:23:16 PM] Yi Kai: Just read lah...
[6/10/19, 9:23:23 PM] Yi Kai: What's so sien about it
[6/10/19, 9:23:31 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: feel like sleeping when i read
[6/10/19, 9:23:38 PM] Yi Kai: google translate
[6/10/19, 9:23:50 PM] Yi Kai: Actually, it makes reading chinese less of a struggle
[6/10/19, 9:24:03 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: lol ok illtry that
[6/10/19, 9:24:55 PM] Yi Kai: Also, which reactions are reversible ah?
[6/10/19, 9:25:53 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: huh
[6/10/19, 9:25:59 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: esterification
[6/10/19, 9:26:18 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: dissociation of weak acid
[6/10/19, 9:26:33 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: reaction of ammonia and water
[6/10/19, 9:27:29 PM] Yi Kai: to form ammonium hydroxide?
[6/10/19, 9:27:45 PM] Yi Kai: The rest of the organic reactions not reversible ah?
[6/10/19, 9:27:55 PM] Yi Kai: I always miss out the details when studying chem
[6/10/19, 9:28:08 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: in separate ions
[6/10/19, 9:28:42 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: not that i recall of
[6/10/19, 9:28:46 PM] Yi Kai: Ok
[7/10/19, 2:17:51 PM] Yi Kai: You know for csc right, what you focus on ah?
[7/10/19, 2:21:19 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i mug 挑战 建议
[7/10/19, 2:21:24 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: what else can there be ag
[7/10/19, 2:21:37 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: 影响?
[7/10/19, 2:21:46 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i couldnt find a lot of 影响 in the articles tho
[7/10/19, 2:32:14 PM] Yi Kai: In the Tianzhan portion have a bit
[7/10/19, 2:32:30 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: whats tianzhan
[7/10/19, 2:32:34 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: tiao zhan ah
[7/10/19, 2:32:41 PM] Yi Kai: I trust you on this ah?
[7/10/19, 2:32:46 PM] Yi Kai: Yah
[7/10/19, 2:32:48 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: hmmm
[7/10/19, 2:33:07 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: loss of accuracy may result in the loss of marks
[7/10/19, 2:33:50 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: u can just calculate urself whay 30% is from ur 81.5 average for t2 and t3, then 70% of the remaining 70% is ur ses which is 57/70
[7/10/19, 2:34:51 PM] Yi Kai: Eh why I calculate come out 25.53 marks only
[7/10/19, 2:49:26 PM] Yi Kai: Like bernard's notes included how it relates to sg
[7/10/19, 2:50:13 PM] Yi Kai: But actually it covers more of positive impacts on other countries
[7/10/19, 3:02:05 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: thats better anyways
[7/10/19, 3:02:09 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: need meh
[7/10/19, 3:02:23 PM] Yi Kai: I don't know
[7/10/19, 3:03:02 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: actually whats inside the "很重要" article quoted from wangdk
[7/10/19, 3:03:56 PM] Yi Kai: I forgot which one he was referring to
[8/10/19, 10:14:09 AM] Yi Kai: Wait just realised Tianyi is still in every single class chat that exists
[8/10/19, 10:14:30 AM] Yi Kai: Like the chats with all the teachers
[8/10/19, 10:21:02 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: mm
[8/10/19, 10:21:10 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i wonder hows hes doing
[8/10/19, 10:30:20 AM] Yi Kai: Lol
[8/10/19, 10:30:28 AM] Yi Kai: Anyway physics what to Mug siah
[8/10/19, 11:08:20 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i also dk
[8/10/19, 3:51:07 PM] Yi Kai: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOLmD_WVY-E

Guan Lin
[8/10/19, 3:57:33 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: what about him lol
[8/10/19, 3:58:21 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: reminds me abt the el compre on moderation
[8/10/19, 4:48:20 PM] Yi Kai: "Why incompetent people think they're amazing" -> "Highly rated tournament player"
[8/10/19, 4:54:07 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: of course he is!
[8/10/19, 4:54:12 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: who r u to doubt his abilities!
[8/10/19, 4:55:28 PM] Yi Kai: One who claims infinite capabilities which he simply refuses to use is equivalent to one without any capabilities
[8/10/19, 4:55:34 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: integration of f(ax+b) = F(ax+b) × 1/(f'(ax+b)
[8/10/19, 4:55:37 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: is it true to say this
[8/10/19, 4:58:30 PM] Yi Kai: What's the big f mean?
[8/10/19, 4:58:39 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: integrated
[8/10/19, 4:59:27 PM] Yi Kai: How's that even true?
[8/10/19, 4:59:31 PM] Yi Kai: I'm vv confused
[8/10/19, 5:00:51 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: cus when u differentiate F(ax+b) u will need to time differentiated ax+b cus of chain rule
[8/10/19, 5:01:01 PM] Yi Kai: Doesn't this completely depend on f?
[8/10/19, 5:01:05 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: so if u divide it away it cancels out
[8/10/19, 5:01:10 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: wdym
[8/10/19, 5:01:35 PM] Yi Kai: I'm not used to f, F and f'
[8/10/19, 5:02:36 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oh
[8/10/19, 5:02:44 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: nvm i think its too complicated lll
[8/10/19, 5:02:46 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: lol
[8/10/19, 5:02:49 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: and quite useless
‎[8/10/19, 5:03:22 PM] Yi Kai: ‎image omitted
[8/10/19, 5:03:31 PM] Yi Kai: So I don’t think it’s true at all
[8/10/19, 5:04:47 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: thanks
[11/10/19, 9:37:19 PM] Yi Kai: What do you do these days lol
[11/10/19, 9:37:39 PM] Yi Kai: Also, I recommend penstock youtube channel for pen spinning tutorials, I semi-learnt reverse sonic lol
[11/10/19, 9:57:23 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i have nth to do at home tbh
[11/10/19, 9:57:28 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: probably should do sonething useful
[11/10/19, 9:57:47 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: like learn coding!
[11/10/19, 9:57:50 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: or photoshop!
[11/10/19, 10:01:27 PM] Yi Kai: Yah why not
[11/10/19, 10:01:30 PM] Yi Kai: Take computing in jc
[11/10/19, 10:04:31 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: still considering
[11/10/19, 10:04:36 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: im fine w either tbh
[12/10/19, 9:31:34 AM] Yi Kai: But then bio a lot a lot more memorising though

Up to you lah, I suggest you just go like the first 2-3 sessions of NOI training(cause that’s how much H2 computing covers). If you don’t die (that is, can solve 1-2 problems every week) then computing is probably fine
[12/10/19, 10:42:08 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i need foundation first tho
[12/10/19, 10:42:27 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ill probably go look at uni course and stuff and decide soon
[12/10/19, 10:42:34 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: uni courses
[12/10/19, 10:43:06 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: yah which is why im still hesitating on taking bio
[12/10/19, 12:46:20 PM] Yi Kai: Lol up to you lah
[12/10/19, 12:47:01 PM] Yi Kai: Most uni courses that need bio say need bio or chem, and you already have chem
[12/10/19, 12:47:39 PM] Yi Kai: And most of these courses are mainly about substance engineering related
[12/10/19, 1:30:41 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: jc mostly for the experience i guess
[12/10/19, 1:47:17 PM] Yi Kai: True
[12/10/19, 5:59:27 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: where should i start w coding tho
[12/10/19, 8:20:52 PM] Yi Kai: Ok purpose being for jc?
[12/10/19, 8:21:05 PM] Yi Kai: Cause jc uses python, NOI uses C++
[12/10/19, 8:21:48 PM] Yi Kai: If you gonna go for the python version, I recommend Codeacademy (free version will probably do), think they have courses on computer science and it’s done in python
[12/10/19, 8:23:18 PM] Yi Kai: But if you come NOI training and do C++ there’ll be more chance for achievements in competition

Cause most of the zai people in JC next year is from our batch, and a lot of our batch people are getting demoralised over time

So if you can get in it’ll be a good chance. If not you dropout anytime also can one, no one really cares
[12/10/19, 8:23:23 PM] Yi Kai: #ad
[12/10/19, 8:59:40 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: if im only starting next year how can i be that good
[12/10/19, 8:59:45 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oo ok
[12/10/19, 9:34:40 PM] Yi Kai: It doesn't take long
[12/10/19, 9:35:49 PM] Yi Kai: Plus I'm the only one who actively practices, and I only started being more hardcore in practising this year.

Like 'cause most of us think it's something that can't be practised, until this year there was some ri sec 3 guy who did like 65 contests (2 hours each, for practice) and got top 4 for his NOI
[13/10/19, 10:01:07 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oh wow
[13/10/19, 10:18:14 AM] Yi Kai: Yeah...

Same as the other Olympiads, the main 3 powerhouses are NUSH RI HCI, but HCI becoming more and more trash tbh
[13/10/19, 3:40:57 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: lmao
[17/10/19, 9:23:49 PM] Yi Kai: What you doing these days lol
‎[17/10/19, 9:24:10 PM] Yi Kai: ‎video omitted
‎[17/10/19, 9:24:41 PM] Yi Kai: ‎video omitted
[17/10/19, 9:32:00 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: wtf is this a reversed clip
[17/10/19, 9:32:05 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: nth much tbh
[17/10/19, 9:32:10 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i need to find sth useful to do
[17/10/19, 9:32:24 PM] Yi Kai: No
[17/10/19, 9:32:39 PM] Yi Kai: I did it legitly, it's called sonic harmonic
[18/10/19, 12:11:55 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: siao
[19/10/19, 4:27:12 PM] Yi Kai: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIL1tDvnH4c
[19/10/19, 6:21:30 PM] Yi Kai: I'm surprised you ordered batch shirt
[19/10/19, 6:26:03 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: why not
[19/10/19, 6:31:46 PM] Yi Kai: True
[19/10/19, 8:16:31 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i mean its a drifit so im not complaining
[19/10/19, 8:27:52 PM] Yi Kai: True
[19/10/19, 8:27:57 PM] Yi Kai: And quite cheap
[19/10/19, 8:29:51 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: Lmao throwback to class tee this year
[19/10/19, 8:31:04 PM] Yi Kai: Indeed
[20/10/19, 2:30:35 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: wait r we getting back el results tmr
[20/10/19, 2:31:43 PM] Yi Kai: No
[20/10/19, 2:31:53 PM] Yi Kai: i think tomorrow is more of the mass briefing kind on everyone's general mistakes
[20/10/19, 2:32:00 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: thats so dumb
[20/10/19, 2:32:21 PM] Yi Kai: True
[20/10/19, 2:32:32 PM] Yi Kai: But then we going school anyway so doesnt matter to me
[20/10/19, 2:32:44 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i guess so
[21/10/19, 3:50:16 PM] Yi Kai: The fingerless reverse thumbaround is so much easier than reverse thumbaround
[21/10/19, 4:01:25 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: fingerless?
[21/10/19, 4:11:32 PM] Yi Kai: Yah
[21/10/19, 4:11:38 PM] Yi Kai: The one where you swing your hand around the pen
[21/10/19, 4:47:02 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ou
[21/10/19, 4:47:25 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i mean fingerless u just turn the opposite away
[21/10/19, 4:47:28 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: way*
[21/10/19, 4:47:41 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: reverse thumbaround is like compleyely different
[21/10/19, 4:53:54 PM] Yi Kai: Anyway now I can kinda reverse thumbaround
[21/10/19, 4:54:13 PM] Yi Kai: Yah but gives the feel
[21/10/19, 4:54:30 PM] Yi Kai: So for some time when I try to do normal reverse I just move my hand rather than finger
[21/10/19, 10:28:50 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i still cant do double consistently lol
[21/10/19, 10:48:38 PM] Yi Kai: Thumb spin 2.0 isn’t double
[21/10/19, 10:48:50 PM] Yi Kai: Double is like the continuous fingerless one but 2 times
[21/10/19, 10:49:35 PM] Yi Kai: And honestly I have only about 7 or 8 out of 10
[23/10/19, 10:58:39 PM] Yi Kai: Ugh I feel like blocking randy
[23/10/19, 10:58:46 PM] Yi Kai: Now then 来烦我
[23/10/19, 11:44:20 PM] Yi Kai: What's with the profile pic changes recently
[24/10/19, 6:30:36 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: Lol what happened
[24/10/19, 6:30:59 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: The 1st one was cus i changed phones and couldnt grt back my pfo
[24/10/19, 6:31:00 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: pfp
[24/10/19, 6:31:12 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: the 2nd one my mum wanted me to change
[24/10/19, 6:31:13 AM] Yi Kai: Randy, he has no idea how to set up github
[24/10/19, 6:31:19 AM] Yi Kai: Wow lol
[24/10/19, 6:31:27 AM] Yi Kai: Your dad works overseas or something?
‎[24/10/19, 6:31:57 AM] Yi Kai: ‎image omitted
[24/10/19, 7:48:58 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: wtf
[24/10/19, 7:49:02 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: how did u get it
[24/10/19, 7:54:02 AM] Yi Kai: I screenshot some time ago
[25/10/19, 5:29:08 PM] Yi Kai: By the way, ccme is legit
[25/10/19, 5:29:10 PM] Yi Kai: http://www.hci.edu.sg/uploadfile/college-subjcomb2020/HCI_College_Standard_Subject_Combinations_for_2020_JC_1.pdf
[25/10/19, 6:15:32 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: hmmm
[25/10/19, 6:16:17 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: btw wth is that thing Bernard sent
[25/10/19, 6:16:22 PM] Yi Kai: idk
[25/10/19, 6:16:25 PM] Yi Kai: never heard of it
[25/10/19, 6:16:45 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: so weird
[25/10/19, 6:49:56 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: why cant they just look at our LEAPS
[25/10/19, 7:04:06 PM] Yi Kai: True
[26/10/19, 11:45:34 PM] Yi Kai: Wow double ta is actually quite satisfying

Just that I've ~wasted~ spent easily 1 hour practising it

And sadly you can't do thumbaround anymore...
[27/10/19, 11:24:52 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: u mean the one i always try to do?
[27/10/19, 11:43:19 AM] Yi Kai: No
[27/10/19, 11:43:40 AM] Yi Kai: Basically one where the pen goes 2 legit rounds around the hand
[27/10/19, 11:43:58 AM] Yi Kai: If you’re OP can do continuously for like 10 minutes one
[28/10/19, 10:37:28 AM] Yi Kai: Have you been hardcore mugging Chinese, you’re almost never online
[28/10/19, 10:57:43 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i haven't started lol
[28/10/19, 10:58:08 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: just wasting my life away watching YouTube and reading reddit
[28/10/19, 11:15:30 AM] Yi Kai: Lol same most of the time

[28/10/19, 11:48:45 AM] Yi Kai: Wait wth why does whatsapp make it so pixelated
[28/10/19, 12:00:25 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: lol its damn pixelated
[28/10/19, 12:00:37 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: theres like a total of 500 pixels in the video
[28/10/19, 12:20:13 PM] Yi Kai: Yah but I think you get the idea
[31/10/19, 8:24:47 PM] Yi Kai: Wtf now randy opens a PDF file with atom, sees gibberish, and questions why when he’s finding a HTML file to edit
[31/10/19, 8:25:22 PM] Yi Kai: If you’re still thinking about computing you can go try for NOI training 2 sessions, I’ll be there for only first and last session though
[31/10/19, 9:15:05 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: im probably taking bio i think
[31/10/19, 9:15:15 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ccme too unpopular alr
[31/10/19, 9:57:46 PM] Yi Kai: Ok lorh up to you
[31/10/19, 9:58:21 PM] Yi Kai: It’s indeed unpopular, but it’s valid
[5/11/19, 6:47:43 PM] Yi Kai: Sometimes I regret learning pen spinning 'cause it's damn hard to concentrate on doing work when even my pen is a distraction
[5/11/19, 9:44:59 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: my pen keeps droppjng on the floor when im trying to mug
[5/11/19, 9:52:57 PM] Yi Kai: Lol
[7/11/19, 1:34:11 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: did u rrceive the email from justin loh
[7/11/19, 1:44:49 PM] Yi Kai: DSTA scholarship? Yes
[7/11/19, 1:45:02 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: no harm signing up right
[7/11/19, 1:45:10 PM] Yi Kai: I feel like I should try my luck on the MOE pre-u one but then I lazy fill up form
[7/11/19, 1:45:17 PM] Yi Kai: Yah
[7/11/19, 1:45:26 PM] Yi Kai: But my results so trash, I 1.67
[7/11/19, 1:45:26 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: wait u can have both ah
[7/11/19, 1:45:39 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: idt they care abt msg
[7/11/19, 1:45:46 PM] Yi Kai: Ok true
[7/11/19, 1:45:47 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: more of math and science achievements ibguess
[7/11/19, 1:46:00 PM] Yi Kai: You have meh rng
[7/11/19, 1:46:03 PM] Yi Kai: Tbh*
[7/11/19, 1:46:04 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: does the pre u one require interview
[7/11/19, 1:46:09 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: not rlly
[7/11/19, 1:46:13 PM] Yi Kai: Yah if you selected
[7/11/19, 1:46:29 PM] Yi Kai: But then the criteria is your both languages + 5 other subjects <=8
[7/11/19, 1:46:41 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: below 8 what
[7/11/19, 1:46:43 PM] Yi Kai: Which means only can have one A2

But my Chinese B4 English A2
[7/11/19, 1:46:46 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ohh
[7/11/19, 1:46:58 PM] Yi Kai: You qualify that ah?
[7/11/19, 1:47:05 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: yeah
[7/11/19, 1:47:11 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: chinese a2 ss a2
[7/11/19, 1:47:12 PM] Yi Kai: Oh wow
[7/11/19, 1:47:22 PM] Yi Kai: Ss b3 though for me
[7/11/19, 1:47:35 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: its so tilting
[7/11/19, 1:47:40 PM] Yi Kai: I agree
[7/11/19, 1:48:00 PM] Yi Kai: It’s like I could have had like 4-5 marks more if I knew the idiom skeletons in the closet
[7/11/19, 1:48:17 PM] Yi Kai: They didn’t even put a note and expect us to know, not like the paper was vv easy
[7/11/19, 1:48:29 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: the marking scheme is q dumb they just give the marks however they like
[7/11/19, 1:48:36 PM] Yi Kai: True
[7/11/19, 1:48:46 PM] Yi Kai: Should I drop chem siah
[7/11/19, 1:48:49 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: wtf
[7/11/19, 1:48:57 PM] Yi Kai: ?
[7/11/19, 1:49:03 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: but chem q important tho
[7/11/19, 1:49:06 PM] Yi Kai: True
[7/11/19, 1:49:14 PM] Yi Kai: My greater fear is if I need to take Chinese
[7/11/19, 1:49:17 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: gives u access to the most courses
[7/11/19, 1:49:25 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: how was the paper ysterday
[7/11/19, 1:49:31 PM] Yi Kai: But then most of them related to substance engineering
[7/11/19, 1:49:42 PM] Yi Kai: I screwed up duanwentiankong
[7/11/19, 1:49:44 PM] Yi Kai: 2/10
[7/11/19, 1:49:52 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ouch
[7/11/19, 1:50:06 PM] Yi Kai: Then my primary school classmate from ny will despise me so hard
[7/11/19, 1:50:15 PM] Yi Kai: Ok don’t say that outside but yah

[7/11/19, 1:52:50 PM] Yi Kai: Ok honestly I think the main reason I kept thinking I might not get B4 is my duanwentiankong

[7/11/19, 2:32:12 PM] Yi Kai: But yah I meant it
[7/11/19, 2:34:35 PM] Yi Kai: And if I tell my parents anything abt her they'll start speculating stuff so yah
[7/11/19, 9:48:19 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: understandable
[7/11/19, 9:58:55 PM] Yi Kai: I used to tell them about my convo with her and they kinda guessed correctly that I liked her

But I only knew about their speculations when my sister told me about their convo back then
[7/11/19, 9:59:07 PM] Yi Kai: Other than zhiheng don't tell this to other ppl though
[7/11/19, 9:59:10 PM] Yi Kai: Esp bernard

[20/11/19, 8:00:53 PM] Yi Kai: I originally had a plan on what I want spend time on but in the end I too lazy to do those stuff
[20/11/19, 8:32:38 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: thats me for the whole of this year
[20/11/19, 9:00:30 PM] Yi Kai: If it's sth important I can usually get myself to do it
[20/11/19, 9:00:51 PM] Yi Kai: But then a lot of stuff to do for holidays is not something that must be done
[20/11/19, 9:01:22 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: im only motivated when theres a deadline tbh
[20/11/19, 9:01:35 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: and even when there is i procrastinate until the last day or last few hours to do it
[20/11/19, 9:01:49 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: but then my productivity is like 100% during that short period of time
[20/11/19, 9:13:03 PM] Yi Kai: Lol same, maybe I won’t procrastinate as much but I’ll still procrastinate
[20/11/19, 9:13:23 PM] Yi Kai: That’s why I always wish I was as motivated as my P6 self
[21/11/19, 9:31:37 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i agree
[21/11/19, 9:45:22 AM] Yi Kai: Definitely regretted slacking too much after PSLE

[2/1/20, 7:08:31 PM] Yi Kai: 100 slots...
[2/1/20, 7:08:43 PM] Yi Kai: Sounds like a heck load of ppl like you who want to drop physics
[2/1/20, 7:09:09 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: Lol
[2/1/20, 7:09:26 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: But u can take computing even if u dont join the vourse right?
[2/1/20, 7:09:39 PM] Yi Kai: By right the course says it's compulsory if you want computing
[2/1/20, 7:09:46 PM] Yi Kai: But I don't think they're that strict
[2/1/20, 7:09:49 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: Im actually quite confused by the list of courses
[2/1/20, 7:09:56 PM] Yi Kai: Plus I have ISYF as excuse if they question why I don't sign up
[2/1/20, 7:09:56 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: U can just appeal i guess
[2/1/20, 7:10:11 PM] Yi Kai: Basically join the stuff you think are fun

[29/1/20, 7:54:30 PM] Yi Kai: Like only 20 known cases of people not feeling pain
[29/1/20, 8:25:53 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oh

[13/2/20, 9:59:58 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: math tutorial damn cancer need use gc to calculate crap
‎[13/2/20, 10:00:35 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ‎image omitted
[14/2/20, 3:02:59 AM] Yi Kai: Just desmos lah
[23/3/20, 3:56:18 PM] Yi Kai: I thought I learnt how to pick my combination, so I blindly shuffled the combination and solved it a few times
[23/3/20, 3:56:35 PM] Yi Kai: Then next moment I shuffle it again and realise I can't pick it successfully
[23/3/20, 4:08:10 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: huh what combination
[23/3/20, 4:08:12 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: lock?
[23/3/20, 4:08:20 PM] Yi Kai: yah
[23/3/20, 5:13:52 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: lol
[23/3/20, 5:14:02 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: did u manually unlock it by trying everyth
[23/3/20, 5:26:01 PM] Yi Kai: I didn’t unlock yet
[23/3/20, 5:26:26 PM] Yi Kai: Cause just now I tried picking until my finger pain liao so I stopped trying temporarily
[23/3/20, 6:27:25 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: hmmm
[23/3/20, 6:27:33 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: where r u all at for math
[23/3/20, 6:47:21 PM] Yi Kai: We starting chapter 2A
[23/3/20, 6:47:38 PM] Yi Kai: But our cher was like holiday homework: finish chapter 3
[23/3/20, 6:47:55 PM] Yi Kai: Cause Bernard is a freaking legend and finished chapter 3 before week 10
[23/3/20, 6:51:59 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: lol wth
[23/3/20, 6:52:14 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ok not so bad i thought my class damn slow
[23/3/20, 6:55:04 PM] Yi Kai: Has you class at least finished chapter 1?
[23/3/20, 7:07:20 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: Kind of i guess
[23/3/20, 7:07:28 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: I forgot if we fully finished 1b
[23/3/20, 7:09:37 PM] Yi Kai: Lol ok
[23/3/20, 8:55:32 PM] Yi Kai: Ok I finally got my lock unlocked
[23/3/20, 8:55:51 PM] Yi Kai: Seems like it’s cause that lock was old, so I thought it clicked when it didn’t
[23/3/20, 8:57:11 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i never feel the click
[23/3/20, 8:57:15 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i tried it last time
[23/3/20, 8:57:33 PM] Yi Kai: Ok for combination lock the first method is the click, which I also didn't feel anything
[23/3/20, 8:58:01 PM] Yi Kai: The second method is you put tension, then you keep turning the first digit until you find one that makes the second digit harder to turn
[23/3/20, 8:58:18 PM] Yi Kai: Then just do that for each digit
[23/3/20, 8:58:25 PM] Yi Kai: For me my lock only has 3 digits so yah
[23/3/20, 9:00:22 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ohh
‎[29/3/20, 7:12:15 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ‎image omitted
[29/3/20, 7:12:26 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: im having trouble finding the first term to find the sum to infinity
[29/3/20, 7:16:09 PM] Yi Kai: wdym, you don't have to find the first term what
[29/3/20, 7:16:21 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: huhh
[29/3/20, 7:16:23 PM] Yi Kai: They say express the sum in terms of x for a reason
[29/3/20, 7:16:38 PM] Yi Kai: So it's just x * (blah blah blah)
[29/3/20, 7:16:51 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: but udk which term x is
[29/3/20, 7:17:15 PM] Yi Kai: Oh wait good point
[29/3/20, 7:17:38 PM] Yi Kai: Wait hang on for the common ratios what kind of values do you get?
‎[29/3/20, 7:17:51 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ‎image omitted
[29/3/20, 7:17:59 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: 0.5
[29/3/20, 7:18:48 PM] Yi Kai: But then it's not possible to find the first term what
[29/3/20, 7:19:09 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: u can find n i guess
[29/3/20, 7:19:16 PM] Yi Kai: If I tell you that like 9, 3, 1 and consecutive terms in a geometric series, how will you find the first term?
[29/3/20, 7:19:24 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: then n will tell u the number of terms there is
[29/3/20, 7:19:49 PM] Yi Kai: Ok true if they give you n then you can find
[29/3/20, 7:20:11 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: wait u can divide first eqn by 2nd eqn
[29/3/20, 7:20:14 PM] Yi Kai: But if I don't tell you sth like 9 is the third term in the series, you can't find the first term right
[29/3/20, 7:20:28 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: Sx / Sz is 4 and u eliminate a so u can find n
[29/3/20, 7:20:41 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: in that context ya
[29/3/20, 7:21:05 PM] Yi Kai: Wait Sx refers to the xth term or the sum of the first x terms?
[29/3/20, 7:21:31 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: the latter
[29/3/20, 7:21:40 PM] Yi Kai: then Sx/Sz is not 4 what
[29/3/20, 7:21:41 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oh wait then im wrong
[29/3/20, 7:21:42 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: fk
[29/3/20, 7:21:46 PM] Yi Kai: lol
[29/3/20, 7:21:55 PM] Yi Kai: think they don't give enough info lah
[29/3/20, 7:22:01 PM] Yi Kai: so just take x to be the first term
[29/3/20, 7:22:08 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: its 2017 common test tho
[29/3/20, 7:22:12 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: and like its 5 marks
[29/3/20, 7:22:16 PM] Yi Kai: hmm
[29/3/20, 7:22:22 PM] Yi Kai: supplementary exercise?

[24/4/20, 12:25:24 AM] Yi Kai: Then zhiheng say because of our teacher's youtube channel, his physics cher (erkan) say they look vv cool and ask the students to recreate them
[24/4/20, 12:25:41 AM] Yi Kai: but in covid times, you can't go out to buy the materials for the experiments so...
[24/4/20, 12:25:50 AM] Yi Kai: Cos got things like swinging a cup of water around
[24/4/20, 12:25:59 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oh that thing

[24/4/20, 12:27:15 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: what do u think abt may holidays
[24/4/20, 12:27:22 AM] Yi Kai: One day he showed us a video of him on an escalator throwing a ball vertically to show newton's second law
[24/4/20, 12:27:33 AM] Yi Kai: So we started watching his youtube channel and making stickers
[24/4/20, 12:27:37 AM] Yi Kai: not fun

[24/4/20, 12:28:26 AM] Yi Kai: not willing to initiate but find it vv fun
[24/4/20, 12:28:49 AM] Yi Kai: slight balling feels good for some reason
[24/4/20, 12:28:56 AM] Yi Kai: even with no strong feelings or anything
[24/4/20, 12:29:02 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: whats that
[24/4/20, 12:29:13 AM] Yi Kai: balling as in like chasing girls
[24/4/20, 12:29:21 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ah
[24/4/20, 12:29:33 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: is it bernard ure describing
[24/4/20, 12:29:33 AM] Yi Kai: cos bernard likes to say wenhao's balling all the time based on how he always sits with the ki girls during lunch
[24/4/20, 12:29:46 AM] Yi Kai: bernard surprisingly doesn't talk much to girls
[24/4/20, 12:29:57 AM] Yi Kai: He only talks to one of them, who's vv close to alina
[24/4/20, 12:30:09 AM] Yi Kai: and if you didn't know, his stuff with alina ended
[24/4/20, 12:31:15 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: AHAHAHAHA
[24/4/20, 12:31:31 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i thought i saw someone post about him with alina in the same room in houseparty
[24/4/20, 12:31:44 AM] Yi Kai: Was I the one who told you that
[24/4/20, 12:31:56 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i think i saw it on ryans insta
[24/4/20, 12:32:03 AM] Yi Kai: 😂
[24/4/20, 12:32:13 AM] Yi Kai: ok he was q bitter about it at some time
[24/4/20, 12:32:24 AM] Yi Kai: cos she told her friend that bernard is a possessive freak
[24/4/20, 12:32:25 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: whos he
[24/4/20, 12:32:29 AM] Yi Kai: bernard
[24/4/20, 12:32:36 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: what the heck
[24/4/20, 12:32:43 AM] Yi Kai: then later on they talked it out or sth and decided to remain friends
[24/4/20, 12:32:47 AM] Yi Kai: based on what i understand
[24/4/20, 12:32:55 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: so dramatic
[24/4/20, 12:33:02 AM] Yi Kai: the thing about bernard is that he's more willing to make a move
[24/4/20, 12:33:07 AM] Yi Kai: ...
[24/4/20, 12:33:23 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: are they even in a relationship
[24/4/20, 12:33:25 AM] Yi Kai: i see this as a fairly normal situation
[24/4/20, 12:33:31 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: why would she say this if they were nor
[24/4/20, 12:33:34 AM] Yi Kai: bernard doesn't think so
[24/4/20, 12:33:40 AM] Yi Kai: that's why bernard vv triggered
[24/4/20, 12:34:12 AM] Yi Kai: just saying, my whole MIT is about how bernard finishing math tutorial peer pressures other people to do their math tutorial as well
[24/4/20, 12:34:25 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: LOL
[24/4/20, 12:34:28 AM] Yi Kai: So it's a bit like infectious disease spreading, but it's the mugger spirit spreading instead
[24/4/20, 12:34:56 AM] Yi Kai: my groupmate was just like aiyah dao lah, it's a good meme and it's not graded (cos smtp got the smtp project thing to grade)
[24/4/20, 12:35:10 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oh
[24/4/20, 12:35:19 AM] Yi Kai: But smtp project legit q die
[24/4/20, 12:35:28 AM] Yi Kai: Cos I decided on an idea of making a chat bot
[24/4/20, 12:35:35 AM] Yi Kai: Then I realise I have 0 idea on how to make it
[24/4/20, 12:35:48 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: it can be any subject ah
[24/4/20, 12:35:52 AM] Yi Kai: And then I realised my team mates are slackers
[24/4/20, 12:35:56 AM] Yi Kai: Yah
[24/4/20, 12:36:03 AM] Yi Kai: Can involve more than one subject
[24/4/20, 12:36:06 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: didnt expect that many slackers in smtp
[24/4/20, 12:36:10 AM] Yi Kai: And doesn’t have to be a subject you take
[24/4/20, 12:36:19 AM] Yi Kai: Well coders usually like to slack more
[24/4/20, 12:36:23 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: im salty after wenhao flexed his pw members on knsta

[24/4/20, 12:38:31 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: like when theyre ready to do they will start talking
[24/4/20, 12:38:49 AM] Yi Kai: oh
[24/4/20, 12:39:27 AM] Yi Kai: for my group its like the china scholar q actively searches for stuff
[24/4/20, 12:39:47 AM] Yi Kai: then during call she just puts them out for discussion on which one more useful and what we should say about them
[24/4/20, 12:41:27 AM] Yi Kai: ok i should go sleep
[24/4/20, 12:41:28 AM] Yi Kai: bye

[24/4/20, 7:55:29 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: nah i just keep pausing
[24/4/20, 9:09:21 AM] Yi Kai: As in why you don’t understand the teacher talking
[24/4/20, 9:09:39 AM] Yi Kai: Cos for our class we just read notes and our teacher doesn’t explain much either
[24/4/20, 9:37:22 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i think im just constantly distracted
[24/4/20, 9:37:22 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: lol
[24/4/20, 10:10:18 AM] Yi Kai: Well I think I’m way more distracted with HBL
[24/4/20, 10:10:39 AM] Yi Kai: Most of the video calls I have music in the background
[24/4/20, 10:49:34 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: lol
[24/4/20, 10:49:39 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: how to even concentrate

[24/4/20, 10:50:17 AM] Yi Kai: but i just make sure my music volume is at like 10% so that it's softer than the lecture
[24/4/20, 10:58:42 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: thats not stonks
[24/4/20, 10:59:15 AM] Yi Kai: ...
[24/4/20, 10:59:34 AM] Yi Kai: i mean irl i also not very attentive for lessons
[24/4/20, 10:59:39 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: my econs leceture today is just 6 videos

[24/4/20, 11:00:14 AM] Yi Kai: my econs lecture always livestream video, so one day we were in class streaming our teacher talking
[24/4/20, 11:00:39 AM] Yi Kai: Then suddenly some teacher walked in just to ask "wait y'all are starting market failure alr?!?!"
[24/4/20, 11:01:19 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: LOL
[24/4/20, 11:01:27 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: why r u all so fast even for econs
[24/4/20, 11:01:45 AM] Yi Kai: cos my teacher just say read notes
[24/4/20, 11:01:50 AM] Yi Kai: Then speed through everything
[24/4/20, 11:02:00 AM] Yi Kai: Every week he has like "pre-lesson preparation" pdf
[24/4/20, 11:02:14 AM] Yi Kai: Where you're supposed to like plan for an essay or do an essay before each lesson
[24/4/20, 11:02:19 AM] Yi Kai: or case study question
[24/4/20, 11:13:01 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: what the
[24/4/20, 11:13:13 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: idt my class even does any econ work
[24/4/20, 11:13:23 AM] Yi Kai: the thing is, he will check
[24/4/20, 11:13:31 AM] Yi Kai: Like he will walk one round to make sure everyone did the work
[24/4/20, 11:14:03 AM] Yi Kai: and he wrote in his document that if he check that you never do your work, then you have to stand at the back, so that people will do their work
[24/4/20, 11:14:21 AM] Yi Kai: but cos of this, most people don't do homework for lectures cos he won't check
[24/4/20, 11:32:52 AM] Yi Kai: oh wait have y'all done sth on independent learning programme (ILP) for econs?
[24/4/20, 11:33:12 AM] Yi Kai: cos my classmates say all the other classes are doing it or sth
[24/4/20, 11:36:54 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: yea its due in may
[24/4/20, 11:37:02 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: we barely did anyth tho
[24/4/20, 11:37:08 AM] Yi Kai: what's it about?
[24/4/20, 11:37:23 AM] Yi Kai: our teacher was like "i shall brief y'all about it next week"
[24/4/20, 11:44:06 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: huh what
[24/4/20, 11:44:15 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: we got it at the start of sch

[24/4/20, 11:44:35 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: based on a topic u choose
[24/4/20, 11:44:35 AM] Yi Kai: bro
[24/4/20, 11:44:44 AM] Yi Kai: i think my teacher wants to completely change it
[24/4/20, 11:45:17 AM] Yi Kai: cos he was like i find it unrealistic asking you to set a case study question considering that most teachers find it hard to set such questions
[24/4/20, 12:14:27 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: wth
[24/4/20, 12:14:29 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: thats so broken
[24/4/20, 12:25:00 PM] Yi Kai: Lol yah

[25/4/20, 1:55:45 PM] Yi Kai: go ask wenhao
[25/4/20, 1:55:47 PM] Yi Kai: or bernard
[25/4/20, 1:56:37 PM] Yi Kai: but then bernard may not be willing cos he mainly helps a girl with homework only (and ofc we accuse bernard of crushing)
[25/4/20, 2:51:56 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: LOL
[25/4/20, 2:52:01 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: is this another girl other than alina
[25/4/20, 2:52:31 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: what a beller
[25/4/20, 2:52:33 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: baller
[25/4/20, 2:54:05 PM] Yi Kai: alina's good friend
[25/4/20, 2:54:10 PM] Yi Kai: indeed
[25/4/20, 2:59:45 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: this is getting fishy
[25/4/20, 3:00:03 PM] Yi Kai: hmm
[25/4/20, 3:00:07 PM] Yi Kai: indeed
[25/4/20, 3:49:24 PM] Yi Kai: during CT period we did some sharing thing, and one of the questions was "who did you catch up with"
[25/4/20, 3:49:53 PM] Yi Kai: then bernard say he "caught up with his seniors", and I was thinking vv hard who would he catch up with, cos most of the ssrc people not very close with him personally
[25/4/20, 3:50:09 PM] Yi Kai: Until I realise he has abigail, the facil he kinda hooked up during isyf

[11/5/20, 1:22:16 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: there are multiple solutions for implicit differentiation right
[11/5/20, 1:22:22 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: like for 1 equation
[11/5/20, 1:29:58 PM] Yi Kai: Ya
[11/5/20, 1:31:48 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: oops
[11/5/20, 1:32:58 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: isnt the easiest way avoiding product and quotient rule
[11/5/20, 1:33:21 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: the sollution they give they like to do product and quotient rule instead of manipulating the given equation
[11/5/20, 1:34:20 PM] Yi Kai: Just use the rule bah
[11/5/20, 1:34:44 PM] Yi Kai: Unless you manipulate become much easier
[11/5/20, 1:37:12 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: hmm ok
[11/5/20, 1:37:12 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: thanks
[12/5/20, 12:00:12 AM] Yi Kai: Exco applications for Infocomm club feel so meme
[12/5/20, 12:00:38 AM] Yi Kai: They make it like PIR, but then you it’s a bit the impossible to come up with initiatives if the CCA doesn’t do much to begin with
[12/5/20, 11:39:22 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: wth
[12/5/20, 11:39:38 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: pir was so bad
[12/5/20, 12:01:06 PM] Yi Kai: Ok fine without the interview part
[12/5/20, 12:02:56 PM] Yi Kai: And there isn’t a maumu to enforce random document formatting protocols, so tbh I’m very confused what there is to do as exco
[12/5/20, 12:07:11 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: lol
[12/5/20, 12:07:36 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: stock check annual chronicles
[12/5/20, 12:27:35 PM] Yi Kai: Infocomm has no logistics practically
[12/5/20, 12:27:43 PM] Yi Kai: And publicity is left to secretary
[12/5/20, 12:28:18 PM] Yi Kai: So I prolly gonna go for pres cos nothing to lose and not much popz kids to compete with

[12/5/20, 1:21:50 PM] Yi Kai: And it’s nothing compared to Bernard going for ssrc pres

‎[2/6/20, 5:02:25 PM] Yi Kai: ‎image omitted
[2/6/20, 5:02:33 PM] Yi Kai: 9 kills is insane
[2/6/20, 5:03:13 PM] Yi Kai: Yes I’m not a studious and hardworking stereotypical kid, I play survivio damn regularly now
[2/6/20, 5:03:28 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: lol i uninstalled  it cus i was playing it too much
[2/6/20, 5:03:34 PM] Yi Kai: oh you use the app?
[2/6/20, 5:03:43 PM] Yi Kai: i play a bit too much but i use the website
[2/6/20, 5:04:06 PM] Yi Kai: Every time i try to block it, i end up googling for proxy sites to play so i decided to use self-control rather than just blocking/deleting it
[2/6/20, 5:08:30 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: ya i use the app
[2/6/20, 5:08:41 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i dont really use my comp
[2/6/20, 5:08:52 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: never works for me
[2/6/20, 5:11:22 PM] Yi Kai: like the proxy sites don't work ah?
[2/6/20, 5:11:37 PM] Yi Kai: i don't think i should be suggesting you the sites that worked for me right?
[2/6/20, 5:11:48 PM] Yi Kai: but isn't it harder to play on phone though?
[2/6/20, 5:11:58 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: as in self control never works
[2/6/20, 5:12:06 PM] Yi Kai: oh
[2/6/20, 5:12:07 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: more convenient tho
[2/6/20, 5:12:14 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: but it lags quite bad somemtimes
[2/6/20, 5:12:31 PM] Yi Kai: my self-control only started to work in the past 2-3 days. Like i'll decide to do work 45 minutes, then rest 15 minutes
[2/6/20, 5:12:48 PM] Yi Kai: so i'll only play during a portion of the 15 minutes every hour
[2/6/20, 5:15:09 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: thats dedication
[2/6/20, 5:15:19 PM] Yi Kai: wdym dedication
[2/6/20, 5:15:29 PM] Yi Kai: dedication to play the game or dedication to be productive
[2/6/20, 5:16:13 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: the latter
[2/6/20, 5:16:16 PM] Yi Kai: cos considering that excessive amount of free time i have i guilt-trip myself vvv hard when i'm unproductive (sometimes to the point that i don't feel like trying to improve my productivity)
[2/6/20, 5:16:20 PM] Yi Kai: oh
[16/6/20, 9:18:12 PM] Yi Kai: I find it v weird I have so much free time tbh
[16/6/20, 11:21:19 PM] Boston NPCC 1p2: i have a lot of free time i should be spending on mugging for the math test next week
[16/6/20, 11:42:52 PM] Yi Kai: Same I have like too much free time
[16/6/20, 11:43:32 PM] Yi Kai: Math is free to me so I should probably Mug for GP essay test
[17/6/20, 7:45:52 AM] Boston NPCC 1p2: lol time to fail gp
